The project identifies strategic areas (devolved subjects) of intervention to assist institutional mechanisms for effective, responsive and accountable service delivery for peace and development and ultimately contribute to Sustainable Development Goals. For 2017, the project has identified local governance, human rights, social welfare as core areas of work, the expert will be contributing to the following core components of the project.Devolving Rights in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ProvinceRights Mapping of Vulnerable and Marginalized Populations of PakistanUNDPs rights-based approach to democracy building in Pakistan focusses on capacity development of state- established institutions tasked to protect and promote basic rights. Against this background, UNDPs basic rights programming focuses on technical and capacity-building support for state-established institutions mandated to protect and promote basic rights. In 2010, Pakistan's 18th Constitutional Amendment introduced reforms that significantly changed the governance paradigm by devolving powers to the provinces. In UNDP Pakistan's focal province Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the 18th Amendment has also expanded the scope of Human Rights by devolving women's, children's and minorities' rights to the provincial level. A number of government line departments and institutions are now responsible for the protection and promotion of human rights in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including the Line Department for Law, Parliamentary Affairs and Human Rights. In 2014, the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa further passed the “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Promotion, Protection and Enforcement of Human Rights Act” which resulted in the establishment of the Human Rights Directorate within the KP Line Department for Law, Parliamentary Affairs and Human Rights.In the course of its “Devolving Rights in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa” Project, UNDP Pakistan seeks to strengthen the capacity of the relevant provincial institutions tasked with Human Rights protection and promotion to effectively fulfill their mandates. The overall project aim is to assist the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in establishing its own Human Rights Policy. One of the project's main stakeholders is the newly established Human Rights Directorate which is tasked to monitor the Human Rights situation throughout the province and to provide grievance redressal mechanisms for victims of Human Rights violations.In 2014, Pakistan was granted the special incentive arrangement for sustainable Development and Good Governance under the EU’s Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP+). The related export benefits are however conditional. Regarding Human Rights, Pakistan’s government needs to ensure the effective implementation of seven core Human Rights treaties and fulfill related reporting obligations in order to keep its GSP status. Pakistan has initiated so-called Treaty Implementation Cells (TICs) which have been established both at the federal and provincial level. TICs at the provincial level need additional capacity building support to successfully define and actively shape their mandate.In addition, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals agenda articulates a vision to ‘leave no one behind’ and ‘to reach the furthest behind first’. To achieve these goals Pakistan must address inequalities in all areas and agree that no goal or target be considered met unless met for all social and economic groups of the country. Third or trans-gender people are one of the most marginalized groups in Pakistan. There is an estimate number of 0.5 to 1.5 million third gender citizens across Pakistan mainly living in communities in the urban hubs. Despite the Supreme Court of Pakistan officially recognizing the third gender and calling for the government to ensure its protection, third gender citizens face widespread social, political and economic discrimination. The community is struggling with social and political exclusion and economic debility while the state is failing to provide proper protection mechanisms.To address this challenge D&LG project through its Right Mapping of Vulnerable and Marginalized Populations of Pakistan aims to analyze the root causes for discrimination of Pakistan's third gender population in order to shape future programming activities while ensuring a do no harm approach.

National Consultant,北美洲,External,https://jobs.undp.org/cj_view_job.cfm?cur_job_id=74257,Government Innovation Lab Research Team Leader,"Bangkok, THAILAND",https://jobs.undp.org/cj_view_jobs.cfm,06-Sep-17,,Competencies:Functional Competencies:Strong facilitation skill among various stakeholders;Ability to foster the facilitation in a multidisciplinary and bureaucratic government environment;Strong motivation and ability to work with high-level of government representatives;Excellent communication and analytical skills;Strong networking and interpersonal skills.,Individual Contract,"Why is innovation in government necessary?In recent years, the use of information and communications technologies (ICT) has become increasingly widespread and has not only resulted in improvements in economic productivity but had crucial impact on governments looking to move from rigid, rule-based and hierarchical models of administration to more citizen friendly, transparent and accountable, people-oriented public services.Globally, innovations has made a huge difference in addressing urgent and pressing development challenges such as by responding to climate disasters, by improving avenues to engage citizens in political processes and governance, and by promoting more transparent and responsive governments.Further, the high level panel on the post 2015 development agenda has called for a “data revolution” to dramatically accelerate the progress towards sustainable development. Around the world we are now witnessing the emergence of a variety of new innovations and data alliances that point to a whole new way for governments to inform their policy work with evidence and forge new partnerships with academia, the private sector, think tanks and citizens.What is the regional appetite for Innovation?Innovation is not new to Thailand and Asia-Pacific region. To operate in such a dynamic and often challenging context requires foresight, innovative thinking and agile solutions. Recognizing this, it is observed that governments in Thailand are increasingly investing in various instruments to promote innovation for start-up and within their services. All governments need institutions to catalyze innovation and many leaders at national and sub national leaders recognize this and continue to invest in dedicated teams, units and funds to structure and embed innovation methods and practice in government. Besides more widely known lab models in the West C such as MindLab (Denmark), eGov Lab (Sweden), MaRS (Canada), and the UK Policy Lab, some of the leading governments in the Asia Pacific region are increasingly investing on innovations by establishing National Strategies, Teams, Councils including Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.The region also boasts over 50 innovation labs oriented towards social innovation and improving the design and delivery of public services.What hinders innovation in Governments?While governments have often led pioneering initiatives on innovation and experimenting with nationally constituted models, constraints remain in finding the necessary ‘space’, frameworks and capacity to take the agenda forward; to be able to engage citizens, non-profits and other partners including the private sector to co-design innovative ideas that benefit from the knowledge of the local context; transforms processes, skills and culture of government, and develop pathways to ultimately achieve wider policy and systems change that affects impact at scale.A safe-to-fail space to prototype various programmatic methodologies for development programmes require transforming the bureaucracy culture and no longer stands in a business-as-usual scenario. Research shows that the lack of agility within the public sector, politics, ineffective and untimely communications as well as miscommunications, the absence of a defined framework for exploring new ideas and rewarding status quo are often cited as challenges to driving innovation in government.It is the build-up of innovation capacities that has played a central role in the growth dynamics of successful developing countries.[i] These countries have recognised that innovation is not just about high-technology products or a one-time project but rather requires a shift in thinking, a disciplined approach, strong leadership and collective commitment to ensure sustainability of tested innovative ideas. Therefore, innovation capacity has to be built early in the development process in order to possess the learning capacities that will allow “catch up” to happen. Ultimately, a successful development strategy has to build extensive innovation capacities to foster growth and embed innovation into the main field rather than remain a fringe investment.How cross-sector collaboration adds value?The capacity for governments to embrace social innovation may seem limited, but the work of MindLab, a cross-governmental Danish innovation unit, reveals how new solutions can be developed through collaboration, by co-creating policies with citizens and stakeholders like the private sector through qualitative research and design-led thinking. Similarly, MaRS in Canada also brings together educators, researchers, social scientists, entrepreneurs and business experts under one roof to harness the full potential of social innovation and drive economic and social prosperity. These initiatives demonstrate that while private sector adds value in technology expertise, business acumen and ability to harness new frontier competitive thinking, pairing this with Government enhances the scalability of solutions and offers a proactive space that encourages citizen engagement to inform policy development.This collaborative approach facilitated through a lab model allows for cross-agency interaction involving public servants, private sector technologists, academics, and citizens to co-design the next generation of solutions for social problems.",科学研究,"Bangkok,  THAILAND                      ",,"15 September 2017 C 28 Feb 2018, (Maximum of 110 days)",Sep-6-17,"Degree of Expertise and Qualifications: I.

This Handbook will now be tested and piloted on a national level, with the objectives to sensitize and to tailor to specific national situations the various innovative and inclusive mechanisms proposed in the document.The national roundtable meetings will be part of UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Arab States and Oslo Governance Center’s efforts to establish a dialogue platform and contribute to a relevant analysis and exchange of international best practices. These meetings aim at exploring national dynamics and the crucial roles that constitution-making bodies, parliaments and civil society actors need to play in order to establish measures aiming at advancing social cohesion among citizens and between citizens and the State.In the framework of the project “Parliamentary Accountability for Sustainable Development Goals Implementation” (2017-2021), UNDP has published a Handbook on Parliament’s Role in Implementing the SDGs and developed a model workshop that seeks to support national parliamentary actors in assessing the readiness and capacities of their parliament and in identifying respective approaches and mechanisms for SDG implementation.In this framework, it is recognized that Parliamentary Strategic Development Planning is especially relevant against the backdrop of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Agenda 2030 recognizes that effective, accountable and inclusive institutions - including parliaments - are key to domesticating the SDGs and ensuring quality, accuracy, and efficiency in the monitoring of their implementation at the national level.Strategic parliamentary development plans can both strengthen parliamentary capacity and responsiveness and align the parliamentary institution with development priorities outlined in the SDGs and other national and international standards. By ensuring that the strategic development planning process is adequately inclusive and involves all parliamentary stakeholders, the plan furthermore can become an effective tool and positive starting point for national and international partners seeking to ensure sustainable and democratic development.In addition, the UNDP Somalia Country Office in Mogadishu has recently Parliamentary Support Project that provide technical and material assistance to National Federal Parliament, the parliaments in Puntland and Somaliland as well as the newly emerging parliaments to effectively discharge their functions in relation to law-making, oversight and representation. This support helps creating the foundations for longer-term development, both in terms of building up the parliaments of Somalia as representative, capable and trusted state institutions, as well as working directly with MPs to strengthen their capacities to contribute to nation-building efforts. This Project has five offices namely UNCC and MIA in Mogadishu; Hargeisa. Somaliland; Garawa, Puntland; and Nairobi. Kenya.As for Somalia, which is right now undergoing a historic process of change, moving towards peace from decades of violent conflict, which ravaged the country and resulted in widespread suffering of its people. The Provisional Constitution of the Somali Republic was agreed and endorsed on 1 August 2012. The 9th Parliament was successfully established and remained a stabilizing force during its term of four years. A process is currently under way to elect the members of the 10th Parliament which would now include the newly established Upper House. The newly established Upper House will need support to develop its Rules of Procedure and to train its members to effectively provide support to the emerging Federal Member States.The National Federal Parliament and its members have a critical role to play in Somalia's divided context today. If supported to effectively fill its place in the new political infrastructure of Somalia, the legislature will operate as a venue for the debate and discussion of issues of national importance. Potential sources of conflict can be aired, debated and addressed publicly and in a bi-/multi-partisan manner. To achieve these objectives, both Members of Parliament and the Parliamentary Secretariat require urgent support. Apart of the National Federal Parliament (NFP) functioning parliaments exist in Garowe/ Puntland and in Hargcisa/Somaliland and new assemblies are currently formed in the emerging states.",科学研究,"Amman,  JORDAN                        ",132 working days over a period of 6 calendar months,,Sep-9-17,"EducationMaster’s degree in governance, political science or law, legislative studies, related fields, such as conflict studies, peace building, human rights, policing, etc.Work ExperienceMinimum 1 year of technical expertise, including working experience in developing countries, in the field of governance including both local and international, public administration, conflict management;Experience in drafting and designing documents or similar documents in related fields with international organizations (UN);Experience in strategic prioritisation in the field of parliamentary development;Working experience in conflict or post-conflict countries required for the conduct of the exercise itself, and for understanding the particular context of the evaluation;Proven work experience in use of participatory methods for identifying goals and measurable target indicators;Knowledge of theories, principles and methods in the combination of selective fields of the following: legislative, oversight, representation, etc.;Past service/experience in the UN system is desirable Language RequirementsFluency in English (written and oral)DUTY STATIONThe Junior Consultant will be stationed in Amman (Jordan) and if required to travel to Mogadishu (Somalia) throughout the assignmentTRAVEL PLANDuty station shall be in Amman-Jordan with possibility to travel to Somalia for one month.

The strategic development planning process constitutes as an outstanding mechanism for fostering tailored sustainable and democratic parliamentary development. Strategic planning assumes that institutions must be responsive to this dynamic environment in order to achieve sustainable development. It is a tool for parliaments to determine their long-term goals for development and the best approaches for achieving them, while simultaneously engaging in constant review and reorientation to respond to changing circumstances.3. To assist this process, the consultant is requested to develop a Parliamentary Manual on Strategic Planning Process to Foster their SDGs Capacities. UNDP has previously supported several strategic development plans of Parliaments over the years. The Handbook will draw on this experience by presenting lessons learned, best practices, current legislative and parliamentary process trends, and guidelines as part of an effort to further improve support to Parliaments and UNDP Country Offices. As each Parliament is unique and every country incorporates a signature blend of political, social, and economic factors into the formulation of a strategic development plan, the Handbook won’t thus provide a static set of rules, a fixed matrix, or a pre-formulated plan. Rather, this guide is intended to provide a framework through which UNDP country offices might more effectively engage local partners while offering a variety of strategic development planning options.4. In the framework of the efforts to foster the involvement of Arab Parliamentarians in the Agenda 2030 implementation, UNDP is currently working on the development of a partnership with UNESCWA.

This seminar will gather champions MPs from the region. This regional event on parliamentary engagement on the agenda 2030 will be the starting point of an on-going partnership to promote and strengthen the Arab parliamentarians’ role for the Agenda 2030, at national and regional levels. This partnership may then explore the organization of follow-up events and the development and activation of a platform or a network of Arab Parliamentarians on the Agenda 2030. The focus of this network would be placed on dialogue between national parliaments to encourage best practice and engagement on the Agenda 2030.Under the Provisional Constitution, the National Federal Parliament (NFP) has been tasked with leading the process of constitutional review and implementation, which is required to finalize a national Federal Constitution and set in place a framework for national elections.

Cette élection qui a bénéficié du soutien technique et financier de la Communauté internationale a permis au pays de renouer avec les institutions de financement dont ceux de Bretton Woods. Les élections législatives devraient permettre à la suite des présidentielles de parachever la transition au cours du premier semestre de l’année 2011. La perspective de ces élections a été annoncée et cependant reportée trois fois de suite par la CENI. Malgré des préparatifs techniques à finaliser pour permettre la tenue de ces échéances, la classe politique s’était polarisée autour de questions essentielles portant sur les modalités de révision du fichier électoral, la composition de la CENI et le respect des libertés politiques.A la suite d’un dialogue politique de près de trois mois de décembre 2011 à février 2012 regroupant l’administration et la classe politique, un consensus a été obtenu sur certains points de revendication majeures, il s’agit notamment de l’unanimité sur la nécessité d’un exercice de vérification indépendant du fichier électoral, du respect de l’autorité de l’Etat, de la liberté d’exercice des activités politiques, du libre accès par les partis politiques aux médias publics, de la neutralité de l’administration, de la recomposition des démembrements de la CENI, de l’amendement de l’article 162 du code électoral attribuant au président de la CENI des pouvoirs d’annulation des procès-verbaux de centralisation des votes. Sur la portée des activités à entreprendre sur le fichier électoral, le dialogue politique a dégagé un consensus pour une opération de révision conformément au Code électoral.Dans ce contexte, le 27 avril 2012 le Président de la République n'a pas pris le décret de convocation du corps électoral le 8 juillet 2012, en estimant que les conditions techniques n'étaient pas réunies, et a appelé la CENI à ?uvrer à la finalisation d’un nouveau chronogramme réaliste. Il a invité également à la mise en place d’un espace permanent inclusif de concertation entre la CENI, les partis politiques et les partenaires techniques et financiers.Après plusieurs négociations entre l’opposition et la mouvance présidentielle, la Guinée a sollicité, la médiation de la Communauté Internationale par un courrier adressé au Secrétaire Général des Nations Unions Unies. Ce dernier a désigné son Représentant Spécial Said Djinnit comme médiateur de la crise guinéenne. C’est dans ce contexte que l’accord politique du 3 juillet 2013 a été signé par tous les acteurs politiques pour la tenue des élections législatives le 24 septembre 2013.Dans un souci d’accompagner le processus de gouvernance démocratique, le programme des Nations Unies pour le Développement (PNUD), la Commission Européenne, les partenaires au développement et le Gouvernement se sont engagés à appuyer les cycles électoraux sur la période 2010-2012. C’est dans ce contexte qu’une convention initiale est signée entre le PNUD et l’Union Européenne autour du ?Projet Appui au Cycle Electoral?2010-2012?.Les composantes du projet sont organisées en trois phases?:Composante ?Support technique, opérationnel, et appui? financier à la CENI, au MATAP pour la mise en ?uvre des opérations pré- électorales essentielles à l’organisation de deux scrutins pour 2010?? (élections présidentielles et législatives)Composante ?Appui financier et technique à l’organisation de scrutins de 2010 et la mise en ?uvre des opérations électorales des échéances présidentielles et législatives?Composante? Planification stratégique et appui au développement des capacités institutionnelles à long terme?. Il s’agit des activités postélectorales de renforcement de capacités au cours du cycle électoral 2010-2012-activités à mettre en ?uvre au-delà des évènements électoraux et/ou toutes autres consultations rendues nécessaires pendant ladite période.L'objectif spécifique visé est de contribuer à un déroulement optimal des élections législatives à travers l’acheminement des matériels et équipements vers les bureaux de vote, la récupération et la sécurisation après le scrutin, dans la perspective de leur exploitation pour les futures échéances électorales, notamment les élections communales. Le projet encouragera également les partis politiques guinéens à travailler ensemble dans la planification et la mise en ?uvre des efforts des délégués des partis politiques, de manière à réduire les tensions politiques, à accroitre la transparence électorale, et à renforcer la confiance du public dans les institutions démocratiques. A la phase préélectorale, le programme prévoit la réalisation d’un audit du fichier électoral ayant servi à l’élection présidentielle de 2010, le recrutement d’un expert logistique, le renforcement de la confiance des partis politiques et de l’électorat ainsi que la formation des agents des bureaux de vote.Les bénéficiaires du projet sont in fine les partis politiques et les électeurs guinéens. Le PNUD sera responsable de la gestion et de la mise en ?uvre des activités du projet. Dans ce cadre, il assure la contractualisation, la supervision générale des activités du projet, et la coordination avec les parties prenantes.En définitive, après la convention de base initiale et les 3 avenants successifs ayant pris en compte de nouveaux besoins exprimés par la partie nationale, les composantes du projet se présentent comme suit:Composante 1 C Ressources humaines;Composante 2 C Equipements, matériels et fournitures;Composante 3 C Formation;Composante 4 C Visibilité et communication.Ces quatre composantes couvrent huit activités principales qui sont:La vérification du fichier électoral ayant servi à l’organisation des élections présidentiellesde 2010;Le recrutement d’un expert logistique pour déploiement, la récupération, la sécurisation et le stockage du matériel électoral;Le renforcement des capacités des coalitions des partis politiques guinéens en planification stratégique, recueille, analyse et l’utilisation convenable et efficace des informations le jour de l’élection;La formation des agents de bureaux de vote;L’impression et l’acheminement des bulletins de vote vers les ambassades de Guinée à l’étranger;La dotation des agents de la FOSSEL de signes distinctifs et de matériels conventionnels de protection;Le renforcement des capacités législatives de l’Assemblée?Nationale (légistique);La mise en place et l’opérationnalisation des Centres d'Education Civique et Electorale.",科学研究,"Conakry,  GUINEA                        ",Non renouvelable,35 Jours ouvrables,Sep-11-17,"Etudes : Master en économie, sociologie, relations internationales.Experience :Quinze (10) ans d’expériences en matière de gestion du développement dont au moins 15 ans dans l’évaluation de programmes et des projets notamment dans des pays en développement.Langues: Fran?ais et Anglais.L’appel à candidature est ouvert à tout Consultant International ayant une expérience dans l’évaluation des politiques publiques?; et pouvant fournir le minimum de compétences requises (Expert International) TDRs.Les dossiers de candidatures doivent être composés comme suit:Offre technique:la lettre de soumissionla note de compréhension de la mission;la note méthodologique détaillée ;le chronogramme détaillé de la mission;les CV et ou formulaires P11 des nations unies;Les références techniques pour les missions similairesles références techniques des consultants sur les missions similaires.Offre financiere ( voir le model dans les TDRs en PJ)NB tout dossier incomplet sera rejeté.Constitution des offres et méthode d’évaluationLes offres seront constituées d’une offre technique et d’une offre financière.

The SP identifies a specific result in its Integrated Results and Resources Framework related to innovation: “innovations enabled for development solutions, partnerships and other collaborative arrangements.” To achieve these results, UNDP focuses on the following two areas: Innovative methodologies and tools for scanning the horizon, collecting and analysing data, ideating and reflecting, and prototyping and testing development solutions; and Innovative methodologies and tools for co-designing and scaling up demonstration projects identified/developed and ready for application. Collaboration across sectors (public, private, civil) with traditional partners and as well as those actors less historically engaged is a key element of this strategy.The UNDP Innovation Facility, launched in 2014, supports initiatives that a) strengthen UNDP’s position as a leading advisor on innovation for development; b) enable national development actors to co-create value; c) increase understanding of the role and value of innovation for development; d) support social innovators both within the organization and from the broader development community; and finally, e) enhance UNDP’s own performance efficiency through innovative practices.UNDP Arab States Regional Innovation Facility, based in the Regional Hub in Amman, supports 18 Country Offices as well as Regional Hub colleagues in various professional areas, including Governance & Peacebuilding, Sustainable Development, Environment & Energy, and Gender. Regional innovation activities focus on Behavioral Insights, Games for Social Change, Data Innovation (including big data and micronarratives), and Alternative Financing Mechanisms.Learn more about the Innovation Facility at www.undp.org/innovation.ContextIn recent years, the world has witnessed new waves of violent extremism that have taken the lives of many innocent people. Whether based on religious, ethnic, or political grounds, extremist ideologies glorify the supremacy of a particular group and oppose a more inclusive and tolerant society.In response to the growth of violent extremist (VE) groups, UNDP has developed a global framework[1] on the prevention of violent extremism and implemented a number of projects in the Arab States where violent extremism has a significant regional dimension given the high VE interlinkage between countries in the region. This framework is based on the UN Secretary-General’s 2016 Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism (PVE), which considers VE a ‘diverse phenomenon, without clear definition and it knows many manifestations that are very context specific in nature and linked to a myriad of structural and individual drivers’.Building sustainable approaches that tackle the causes of VE is hampered by a lack of robust evidence around what types of interventions are effective in reducing the influence of extremist groups.[2] This, coupled with the lack of agreed definitions and robust understanding of different pull and push factors for radicalization and VE, poses a significant challenge. Without a framework through which to understand the dynamics and a methodology to measure impact, it is difficult to build a picture of which interventions are most effective in preventing violent extremism, what it takes to make them effective, and how to best target resources sustainably.Given these challenges, the regional Innovation Team, in collaboration with two UNDP Country Offices (COs) C Tunisia and Yemen C and the regional Governance and Peacebuilding Team, has designed an initiative to test the use of Behavioral Insights in Preventing Violent Extremism. With this initiative, we hope to support Country Offices’ efforts to: 1) better understand how to affect contributing factors, both structural drivers and individual motivations, to violent extremism; 2) understand the types of interventions that are effective in reducing the influence of extremist groups and reducing the propensity to become radicalized; and 3) measure the impact of various interventions.",科学研究,Homebased,6 calendar months until end of March 2018,,Sep-10-17,"EducationA masters-level degree in behavioral and social sciences, political science, international relations, conflict resolution or related fields.Work ExperienceAt least 7 years of progressively professional experience in behavioral insights research, conflict assessment and prevention, peacebuilding or similar at the national or international level;At least 3 years of experience in designing, executing, and analysing RCT experiments.Language RequirementsLanguage proficiency in written and oral English is required; Arabic is an asset.INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS/He shall perform tasks under the general guidance of the Regional Innovation Team Lead at UNDP’s Regional Hub in Amman;The supervision will include approvals/acceptance of the deliverables/outputs, including for payment, as identified in previous sections;The individual is expected to liaise and collaborate in the course of performing the work with UNDP colleagues in UNDP Tunisia and Yemen Country Offices and at the Regional Hub, private and public sector stakeholders, and other national and international consultants as necessary;S/He will report to the Innovation Team Lead for the UNDP Regional Hub in Amman.

The underlying purpose of establishing the NPC was to ensure independence, freeing the Police Service from interference or undue influence; and to instill respect for Rule of Law among all ranks of the Police Service and to perform their duties impartially and fearlessly. The key functions of the NPC are human resources management of the police service and investigating into public complaints against police.Building on the work undertaken in 2016 and early 2017, UNDP Sri Lanka seeks to provide support to the National Police Commission (NPC) to strengthen its efficiency and effectiveness as an independent oversight body relating to policing.UNDP is planning to hire a Rapporteur for NPC to prepare constructive reports on Community Consultations and Technical Consultations according to the work plan.The Target group and methodology of community consultation and technical consultations are set as follows;Target group for community consultation;NPC is planning to invite general public through the Divisional Secretary’s office to cover a cross section of the community.

In Turkmenstat’s structure, foreign trade statistics is a part of the Trade Unit of the Trade, Transport and Communication Department. The foreign trade statistical information is prepared at the centralized level based on the customs data.Foreign trade statistics in Turkmenistan is poorly presented at international level. Data on trade in goods is mainly available in the form of mirror statistics reported by other countries, no data is available on trade of services.The current data management system which uses Eurotrace DOS (installed in 1998) does not enable the effective and efficient processing of the data Windows transmitted by the State Customs Committee. This is because the existing Eurotrace DOS system is out of data and does not meet the current needs of Turkmenistan to effectively compile and disseminate IMTS for Turkmenistan.The failure to regularly disseminate good quality, timely and detailed data on IMTS is caused by the lack of a more robust and modern software to compile and process Customs data. Therefore, there is an urgent need to upgrade the existing Eurotrace DOS version to the latest available Eurotrace Windows version. In 2017, UNDP and Turkmenstat signed a joint project “Support to Improvement of the Foreign Trade Statistics in Turkmenistan” that, among other activities, envisages upgrading the existing Eurotrace DOS version to the latest available Eurotrace Windows version.Therefore, there is an immediate need for sharing good practices on the use of Eurotrace in trade data processing and its maintenance. Organization of the specialized trainings/workshops on trade dissemination and trade indices modules of the Eurotrace software is crucial to expose Turkmen specialists to the best practices in International Merchandise Trade Statistics.The abovementioned interventions will enable the State Statistics Committee to:Provide good quality state statistics on foreign trade in Turkmenistan;Benefit from better coordination with the State Customs Service in collecting, compiling and processing the foreign trade data;Develop the knowledge on international standards in international merchandise trade statistics.To achieve the above-mentioned objective of the project, UNDP is looking for an International Expert on IMST. The tasks will be implemented under the Component 2: Enhancing institutional capacity and cooperation for compilation of high quality foreign trade statistics in line with international standards.The assessment revealed that there is a need to establish effective institutional arrangements in Turkmenistan in order to provide quality data for IMTS.According to the international practice, statistical office bears the overall responsibility for the country official trade statistics, including issuance of methodological guidelines, raw data editing and processing, database maintenance and dissemination of official statistics. Customs authorities bear responsibility for the collection of the basic records and for supplying the statistical office with these records on a regular basis: normally, customs would carry out some editing of records before passing them to the statistical office. Other governmental agencies provide additional information on trade flows not covered by customs records. The statistical office further edits all input data and merges them into a consistent data set.In Turkmenistan, particular challenges for statistical data processing arise when revisions or corrections need to be coordinated and agreed between customs and Turkmenstat. These two institutions should work closely and together on elaboration of a common understandable national methodology for collecting, compiling and processing the data on foreign trade, because since 2013, the State Customs Service of Turkmenistan has been applying the 2012 version of WCO, which is equal to the Commodity Nomenclature of Foreign Economic Activity of the CIS countries (TN VED CIS 2012), while foreign trade statistics of the Turkmenstat is processed based on the 1996 WCO HS version (TN VED CIS version).In order to address this issue, the assessment mission recommended Turkmenstat to update Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) with the State Customs Service as well as with other source agencies, including specialized agencies (energy, oil, gas, etc.). MoU shall determine roles and responsibilities of each party with regard to all aspects of the production, compiling, revisions and distribution of official statistics are clearly defined and elaborated in sufficient detail, and will be regularly updated to reflect developments and changes.

The Guiding Principles consist of three pillars: a) The State duty to protect Human Rights; b) the corporate responsibility to respect Human Rights; c) the need for greater access to remedy for victims of business related abuses. The Human Rights Council recommended all states to adopt a National Action Plan on the implementation of the Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework.Though Asia Pacific lags somewhat behind other regions in following up on the implementation of the Guiding principles, there are encouraging signs of companies and governments increasingly more ready to embrace the new set of standards.To support the implementation of the Guiding Principles in Asia-Pacific, UNDP Regional Hub has launched the initiative “Supporting Regional and National Partnerships for the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in Asia Pacific”.The goal of this regional initiative is to build on Regional Institutions to increase the level of compliance of states and businesses with international human rights standards. It will aim to achieve this by strengthening the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights through four principal outputs. Under the first, regional strategies will be developed and states will adopt National Action Plans on business and human rights; under the second, decision-making on business and human rights will be expanded to include CSOs and marginalized groups; under the third, NHRIs will improve their capacities to oversee the compliance of states with the UN Guiding Principles and deal with cases of transboundary nature. The fourth output will expand access to remedies for victims of human rights violations through a provision of legal aid, strategic litigation and raising legal awareness.",科学研究,"Bangkok,  THAILAND                      ",3-6 months,,Sep-13-17,"Education:Enrolled in a graduate school programme i.e. Public Administration, Public Policies, International Development, International Relations, Master of Laws or any other relevant field; orEnrolled in a final academic year of a first university degree programme, i.e.Public Administration, Public Policies, International Development, International Relations, Master of Laws or any other relevant field; orGraduated with a Master’s degree and if selected, must start the internship within one year after graduation.Experiences:Knowledge of international development trends, especially related to the areas of work mentioned above governance in Asia-Pacific countries;Knowledge of UN Human Rights Architecture, the Bill of Rights and the main Human Rights Treaties;Knowledge of and experience in Business and Human Rights area is strong asset;Strong interpersonal, communication/presentation and negotiation skills;Highly organized and independent/motivated;Research ability; strategic, analytical and drafting abilities;Excellent writing and drafting skills in English as well as good communication skills, flexibility and internet research capabilities;Experience editing images or preparing graphics for the web and email communications;Experience engaging and building communities on social networks, particularly Twitter and Facebook;Ability to successfully interact with individuals of different cultural backgrounds and beliefs, which include willingness to try and understand and be tolerant of differing opinions and views.Language:Fluency in English.Conditions:UNDP internship programme does not provide a salary or remuneration for the internship;All the expenses connected with the internship will be borne by the intern, sponsoring Government or institution;UNDP accepts no responsibility for costs arising from accidents and/or illness or death incurred during the internship;The intern is responsible for obtaining necessary visas and arranging travel to and from the duty station where the internship will be performed;Interns are not eligible to apply for any post (Fixed-Term Appointment, Temporary Appointment, Service Contract, Individual Contract) in UNDP during the period of the internship;Interns must provide proof of enrollment in health insurance plan;Interns are not staff members and may not represent UNDP in any official capacity.Subsequent Employment:There is no expectation of employment with UNDP following an internship.UNDP is committed to achieving workforce diversity in terms of gender, nationality and culture.

A person who has stepped on landmine usually suffers such severe disruption of the limb(s) that surgical amputation of one or both legs results even when a traumatic amputation is not immediate. If a person is injured while handling a mine/ERW, it often results in the loss of one or both hands, victims are frequently blinded or suffer traumatic injuries to the abdomen, chest and spinal column. While landmine survivors having Critical Incidence Stress (CIS) which is normal response to abnormal event (landmine explosion) are provided by the medical care and rehabilitation, but, as a rule, most survivors of landmine accidents have different immediate and delayed reactions to CIS, however, they usually do not receive first psychological aid (FPA) and psycho-social rehabilitation.Since 2005 TMAP’s Victim Assistance Programme provided psycho-social rehabilitation support to more than 600 landmine/ERW victims and their families through different types of psycho-social support projects, namely, organizing of peer-to-peer support training for landmine survivors, summer rehabilitation camps for landmine survivors, capacity building training for local doctors and nurses on provision of the first psychological aid to persons with disabilities, including landmine survivors (2013-14).

The 1991 Constitution of Sierra Leone (Act No 6 of 1991) and the Ward Boundary Regulation, 2008, requires Constituencies and Wards to be “as nearly equal to the population quota as is reasonably practicable”. Furthermore, the Constitution & Ward Regulations require the NEC-SL to review Constituency & Ward Boundaries at intervals of not less than 5 and not more than 7 years. The current 112 Constituencies were delimited in November 2006 for the 2007 Parliamentary Elections and the current 394 Wards were delimited in 2008 for the 2008 Local Council Elections.The justification for drawing electoral boundaries of Constituencies and Wards for the 2018 elections was based on the following: a) the Constitutional obligation to redraw electoral districts in a timely manner; b) large population variations across the current constituencies and wards; and outdated population and other data. The current Constituency boundaries were drawn almost eleven years ago and the ward boundaries were drawn nine years ago. As a result, the constituencies and the wards vary dramatically in population. Constituency Boundaries and Ward Boundaries have neither been drawn nor reviewed for ten years (in the case of constituencies) and, eight years (in the case of wards). This is contrary to Section 38 (4) of the constitution, which requires NEC to review boundaries at intervals of between five to seven years. In 2015, Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL) conducted a national population and housing census. Sierra Leone, like many countries, delimits electoral boundaries after a national census, using the census data. This is because census population data provides reliable source of data for creating constituencies and wards that are relatively equal in population. Census data is also useful for planning voter registration exercises and locating polling centres. According to the provisional census data released by SSL in April 2016, the population of the current constituencies and wards vary dramatically. And finally, administering an election effectively requires that the delimitation of electoral boundaries precede all other election-related tasks as it facilitates, among other things, the preparation of an accurate voters’ register and the correct placement of polling stations.In September 2016, UNDP and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland as represented by Irish Aid signed a Third-Party Cost Sharing Agreement to fund NEC to conduct delimitation under the “Support to Boundary Delimitation Project”. The funds covered the following objectives: i) Institutional capacity of the NEC for effective boundary delimitation strengthened; ii) Stakeholders’ participation in the boundary delimitation process promoted; iii) Public sensitizations on Boundary Delimitation promoted; and iv) Capacity of National and District Boundary Delimitation Monitoring Committees strengthened. Although the Project was expected to end in January 2017, due to unforeseen circumstances the Project end date has been extended to 31 December 2017. The passing into law of the Provinces Act (CAP 60) 2017 on 13 March 2017 resulted in creation of additional districts, provinces and localities. Subsequently, NEC had to incorporate the new districts, provinces and localities as defined in the Provinces Act (CAP 60) of 2017. Re-districting had a significant impact on the already tight electoral timeline and further delayed legislation of the delimitation report by Parliament. It is anticipated that Parliamentary will soon pass the delimitation report and this will result into creation of additional seats from 475 to 511. The passing of the delimitation statutory instrument will be followed by public sensitization on the new electoral boundaries (Wards and Constituencies), which is scheduled to start in August 2017.

The IESPC has established three (3) Sub-Committees that coordinate security sector responses in relation to the Election Security Strategy, Communication, and Training. The main objectives are to produce a comprehensive Election Security Strategy, Election Training Manual, and a Communication Strategy to ensure that a safe and secure environment is created for the conduct of peaceful elections in Sierra Leone in March 2018. The Communication Strategy will outline how the IESPC will deliver high quality communications to promote IESPC activities and create platforms to engage with the public on election security related issues.For a safe and secure environment during the elections, the public must embody the values that underpin democracy such as respect in the rule of law, belief in political tolerance and confidence in the political system. The population must also have knowledge about the institutions, practices and basic rules which are the foundation of democracy. The overall Communication Strategy will develop linkages between the media, safety and security and the electoral education campaign for citizens. The IESPC and its constituents have an exciting opportunity to communicate with, and connect people, around the country through traditional media outlets and social media.The content of what is communicated during this period will be developed creatively by the IESPC Communication Sub-Committee with the Office of National Security, The National Security Council (NSC), the National Security Council Coordinating Group (NSCCG) the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) and the Provincial/District/Chiefdom Security Committees, National Electoral Commission (NEC), Political Parties Registration Commission (PPRC), National Commission for Democracy (NCD) and Civil Society.

Governments, security agencies, local communities and others are particularly concerned about the potential security threat emanating from this phenomenon. Even though anecdotal evidence suggests that many foreign fighters have either no intention of leaving Syria/Iraq at all, or aspire to move on to other conflict zones in the future, a significant number has already and may continue to return to their former home countries. Events such as the attack on the Jewish Museum in Brussels in May 2014 by a returnee from Syria, the assault on the staff of the French Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, as well as the largescale Paris attacks of November that year committed by individuals connected to foreign fighters, have shown that there is a clear security risk connected to the phenomenon.Kosovo central level stakeholders have approved in 2016 the Strategy on Prevention of Violent Extremism and Radicalization leading to Terrorism 2015 C 2020 and its action plan. Implementation of this action plan started during 2016 and besides a central level working group, under the responsibility of the Office of the Prime Minister, line ministries are also responsible for forming technical working groups at their own entity level to monitor/guide the activities assigned to them.Under the Kosovo Strategy on Prevention of Violent Extremism and Radicalisation leading to Terrorism 2015 C 2020 and action plan, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology has been assigned a major role in early identification as well as prevention. During the last annual review of the Action plan on CVE, it was noted that MEST requires expert advice in order to further implement its activities. As an initial initiative, UNDP now provides support to MEST on the development of a Practitioner’s Guide on Preventing Radicalization in Schools for use in Kosovo. It will tackle key challenges educators face daily in Kosovar school life by using a methodological bottom-up approach by teachers for teachers. It is further envisaged that the training will take place Kosovo wide on the use of the handbook.UNDP plans now further to support the MEST based on the Abu Dhabi Memorandum on Good Practices for Education and Countering Violent Extremism, which focuses on the ways in which education can be used as a resource and a tool by policymakers, teachers and educators, community-based and other non-governmental organizations (NGO), and families and parents to prevent and counter violent extremism. Education can be leveraged as a tool to achieve both beneficial and harmful results in the context of violent extremism. Therefore, governments, civil society, and the private sector should work together to identify the myriad ways in which education can be utilized to build resilience and reduce recruitment and radicalization to violent extremism. The starting point for the effective role of education in countering violent extremism (CVE) is access to and protection of schools as a safe space - both physically and intellectually. Because education is a universal value, educational environments can be a space for CVE interventions that are effective across cultures and contexts. As with any CVE programming, CVE educational interventions are only relevant if they address the local push and pull factors leading to radicalization and recruitment. Quality education alone is not sufficient for CVE, but it can broadly enable results-based CVE efforts in the education sector.The purpose of the technical specialist is to provide support to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in the field of prevention of radicalization and countering violent extremism in schools in accordance with to the central level action plan on CVE leading to the following critical outcomes:1. Develop a strategy for teachers and administrators regarding prevention of radicalization in different levels of the educational system; the strategy should include close cooperation with the municipal level, civil society, and representatives of religious communities.2.

The overall objective of the Programme is to contribute to an environment of trust and cooperation across the Nistru River generating new perspectives on shared interests and a shared future by people from both banks of the river while responding to their pressing development needs.The SCBM Programme aims to support the skills development and improve capacity of statisticians from both banks of the Nistru River to produce accurate and reliable statistical data, complying with international standards and best practices. Also, it contributes to enhancing of data users’ abilities to make best use of available statistical information, fostering the dialogue and future partnerships between the communities of data experts on both banks. An additional incentive for such an effort would be the growing demand of qualitative data on behalf of local and international data users which are necessary to describe the current status of affairs in different fields of activity and sectors, to identify the occurring shortcomings and prevent potential factors of risk, to design the needed measures and governance decisions.Under the current assignment, the Programme aims to respond to the request of statisticians from the left bank of the Nistru River regarding the launch of preparatory works for developing the tools and methodological materials compliant with international standards, necessary for gradual implementation of the household budget survey on the left bank of the Nistru River.Specific contextA household’s economic well-being can be expressed in terms of its access to goods and services. The more that can be consumed, the higher is the level of economic wellbeing. Measuring consumption expenditure might therefore be a way of measuring economic wellbeing. Statistical surveys of consumption investigate how and why society and individuals consume goods and services, and how this affects society and human relationships.Given the above rationale, one of the topics of cooperation and development support by the SCBM Programme in the statistics area represents the statistical Household Budget Survey (HBS) which is lacking on the left bank of the Nistru (HBS has not been conducted there since 2002) and is well-functioning on the right bank on a continuous basis.On the right bank of the Nistru, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of the Republic of Moldova is conducting two continuous surveys - Labour Force and Household Budget Surveys C which are regularly funded from the annual public budget of the institution. Ad-hoc modules to these regular surveys are periodically carried out with the support of development partners. The HBS conducted since 1997, currently suffers from high level of non-response and continuous efforts are made to reduce this problem. Digitalization of data collection methods from current paper and pencil methods, as well as the redesign of the sampling basis on the basis of the latest 2014 Population and Housing Census are planned in the next 2 years.As it regards the left bank of Nistru, all the official statistics produced by the local specialized statistical service (with the involvement of its 7 territorial statistical units) is based on the administrative and business reporting. The regular statistical surveys involving the population and the households are totally missing from the local statistical system. Nevertheless, the left bank was included for the first time ever the fourth round of MICS (data collected during September-November 2013) which has been carried out through a local NGO and with the participation of the specialists from the statistical service. Also, the latest Population Census has been carried out on the left bank in 2015 and the preliminary results were recently disseminated. Its results might serve as a solid basis for future sampling activities.With this status of affairs in the area of statistics, the stringent need for a Household Budget Survey is acknowledged by the local specialists as a distinct data source on the wellbeing of the population and a solid evidence for region’s policies on social-economic development. It would help to collect monetary data and the qualitative perception of the household. Besides the expenses per se, the survey might also collect information about non-monetary consumption (such as food produced for own consumption), household resources which include individual income (wages, independent earned income, etc.) and revenue received by the household as a whole (benefits, transfers between households, etc.).The work on this topic has been started with a capacity building activity for the statisticians from Tiraspol and other towns on the left bank undertaken by the SCBM Programme in December 2016 including the familiarisation with the concept and methodology of the Household Budget Survey, its advantages, as well as international best practice and experience on production of social statistics.

The central goal is to support the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIROA) in “achieving a paid, professional Afghan National Police (ANP) and staff of the General Directorate for Prison and Detention Centres that delivers essential services to the Afghan people for improved public trust, safety and security” and to support improved rule of law enforcement. The Ministry of Interior Affairs (MOIA) serves as both the political/regulatory body of the police as well as a direct service provider to Afghan police operations. Currently, the ANP is directly subordinated to and encapsulated within MOIA, without any distinction between the MOIA and ANP staff. All 157,000 MOIA staff on Tashkeel (official staffing structure) are also ANP and vice versa.In April 2015, GIROA, UNDP and the donors re-designed LOTFA into two separate but complimentary projects - namely, the Support to Payroll Management (SPM) project and the MOIA and Police Development (MPD) project.The SPM project focuses on supporting MOIA payroll management functions and constitutes approximately 96% of allocated resources under LOTFA. The Ministry of Finance is an important partner in this regard, as it processes and reports on the utilization of monthly advances disbursed by UNDP to cover the salary payments of MOIA personnel.The MPD project focuses on developing national capacity for self-sustained reform and improvement of the MOIA as an institution, as well as police professionalization. The MPD project provides technical advisory and capacity building support to the MOIA and ANP. Specifically, the MPD project has two components:1. The Institutional Development Component which is intended to build the MOIA’s capacity to conceptualize, lead and manage reform, while at the same time improving administrative and ANP support services’ performance and accountability; and2. The Police Professionalization Component which seeks to support the MOIA in strengthening its foundations and training infrastructure for police development, while at the same time supporting immediate police service delivery and outreach activities to strengthen police and community engagement, contributing to increased trust and confidence.Regarding the future directions of the MPD Project, there is a need to focus more at police reform at the subnational level and deepen engagement with local communities to improve their confidence and trust in the police service C as there is an over-concentration of support in Kabul. Key initiatives that are currently being considered but not yet confirmed are: (1) community policing, (2) independent community-based monitoring and reporting, as well as (3) engagement of Afghan civil society, community based organizations including women’s groups.The initial phase of the MPD Project was 18 months from July 2015 to December 2016. Donors and the government agreed in September 2016 to a new four-year phase for the MPD Project from January 2017 to December 2020. Due to the limited time between the official approval and the start of the new phase, stakeholders agreed to first start the new project with limited revisions to the old MPD Project and later in early 2017 to undertake a full review of both the substantive and operational aspects of the project.An internal review in early 2017 covered: (1) the critically low delivery rate of the MPD Project in 2016 (just over 50% against a reduced budget of USD 21.2 million); (2) the start of a new four-year phase of the MPD Project; (3) the expanded scope of the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA), possibly also covering justice and other elements of rule of law; and (4) plans to expand the MPD Project into the regions of Afghanistan. This review did not benefit from detailed consultations with the government nor with donors.In order to anchor the discussions in the needs of the Ministry and the Afghan National Police and to seek inputs from the donor countries, UNDP’s Bangkok Regional Hub is commissioning a project review combined with a review of the project’s staffing structure.A two person team consisting of (1) the Project Review Consultant and (2) an HR Consultant is being recruited to simultaneously conduct the review and to prepare a consolidated report under the leadership of the project review consultant.

DFAs were introduced as the very first development finance studies of their kind, seeking to bring together fragmented approaches on the use of the different sources of funds that may not all be primarily dedicated to address development challenges.The Development Finance and Effectiveness Team also covers work led under the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support (BPPS) as the institutional anchor of UNDP’s work on development cooperation, focusing on the comparative advantages of UNDP in strengthening country capacities to manage and coordinate development cooperation, with particular emphasis on strengthen peer-learning, South-South Cooperation and knowledge sharing as a tool for capacity development.The Team also serves as Secretariat for the Asia Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP-DEF), a country-led regional platform, chaired by the Government of Bangladesh, which supports countries to implement their national agendas on development finance and cooperation. The Facility is a platform for regional dialogue, cooperation, and sharing of country knowledge and experiences. It is responding to the growing demand from countries in Asia Pacific to establish evidence and analysis, and introduce policy and institutional reforms for managing the increasing complexity of domestic and international sources of finance for development.To address these challenges and achieve sustainable development, countries will need to develop new, more effective and integrated approaches to managing public and private finance. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda assumes that countries will use their own national development strategies and plans to respond to the SDGs and calls for the adoption of Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs). These frameworks should provide a structure for governments to form and implement a strategic, holistic, results-driven approach to financing their development objectives. This approach should help countries set a strategy to effectively mobilise the investments they need, and provide a structure that supports coherence across government in channelling resources to the areas they are most suited.The establishment of an INFF represents an ambitious long-term endeavour. While such frameworks do not exist so explicitly in most countries, many on-going initiatives and policy and institutional reforms in the areas of public finance and results-based management provide countries with a good starting basis to build upon. The Consultant will be engaged in assisting UNDP to provide analysis guidance for countries on establishing and strengthening INFFs in Asia-Pacific region while also synthesizing lessons from countries undertaking the DFA.

The project is focused on engaging the Government of Turkmenistan on its duty and capacity to comply with its international human rights obligations and implementing recommendations of human rights treaty bodies, including the recommendations of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). Turkmen National Institute for Democracy and Human Rights under the President of Turkmenistan (TNIDHR) is the main implementing partner of the project and coordinating agency for the implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plan (NHRAP).The country is a State Party to thirteen core human rights treaties and their optional protocols and is yet to ratify several other important UN treaties and optional protocols.During the 2nd UPR cycle in September 2013, Turkmenistan has received 185 recommendations, and accepted 167 of them[1]. The major bulk of recommendations referred to the need of Turkmenistan to align the national legislation with the State’s international human rights obligations and ratify the outstanding human rights treaties and optional protocols, promote human rights through education, trainings, public awareness campaigns among population and improve human rights practices by judiciary, justice and law enforcement officers. They also referred to the need to protect rights of women and children from discrimination, human trafficking and violence through legislative measures as well as support services. The protection of rights of ethnic minorities and people with disabilities was also in focus. The review has also highlighted the need to take measures guaranteeing freedoms of expression including on Internet, assembly and association and to protect the rights of civil society, media and journalists.In 2016, the Government adopted the National Human Rights Action Plan “Strengthening the national capacity of Turkmenistan to promote and protect human rights” (NHRAP 2016-2020) that provides a solid framework and foundation for the implementation of major bulk of UPR and UN Treaty Bodies recommendations. The objective of the Action Plan is to protect, promote and ensure human rights by defining them in the context of public policy, developing the programs for achieving these goals, further involvement of all relevant government bodies and civil society and allocating sufficient resources for the implementation of these programs. The plan envisages measures that address economic, social and cultural rights, civil and political rights, legal system, including the judicial system, law enforcement agencies and bar association (attorneys). Special emphasis is placed upon the issues of gender quality and right of people with disabilities; an integral part of all activities specified the Action Plan.The Action Plan is the result of efforts of the Interagency Commission and its Working Group, established to ensure the implementation of international commitments of Turkmenistan in the field of human rights. The Interagency Commission is a permanent advisory body, which coordinates the activities of all ministries, state committees, agencies, local authorities, enterprises, institutions and organizations related to human rights. The National Institute for Democracy and Human Rights under the President of Turkmenistan (NIDHR) serves as a Secretariat of the Interagency Commission. A Working Group consisting of mid-level executives and specialists of ministries and agencies, public associations that are included to the structure of the Commission, support the work of the Interagency Commission.Turkmenistan’s progress in implementation of the UPR recommendations will be reviewed during the third cycle of UPR - 30th session of Human Rights Council in February 2018.

The chosen means to achieve this goal is through encouraging community-led local development and revitalising community government by MZs, as the places where government comes closest to the people and as grass-roots organisations that serve communities of around 1,000 people, with the possibility for real participation and joint action. The three specific project outcomes are:Citizens and governments are committed to realise the jointly agreed upon new inclusive and gender-sensitive vision of MZs, as foundation for more participatory and accountable local governance in the country;Pro-active, capacitated and inter-connected MZs contribute to downward responsiveness of local governments and improved service delivery;A new regulatory framework for functional MZs developed by governments enables more inclusive, gender-sensitive and accountable local governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The Project will work directly with approximately 120 MZs country-wide and 20 local governments.Gender equality principles are at the core of development agenda of both Swiss and Swedish Governments, while UNDP with its Gender Equality Strategy (2014-2017) puts forward the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women at the center of its mandate as being intrinsic to its development approach.

It is the vehicle to accelerate development as it fosters partnerships among the developing countries, with the view of increasing volume and rate of South-South exchanges in development, peace and security, trade, finance, and technology transfer. In light of the rapid growth in diversity of development actors, particularly from the South, as well as modalities and areas of collaboration, the international development cooperation architecture is changing considerably. The actual and potential contribution of South-South and Triangular Cooperation to the achievement of 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda globally, as well as regionally in the Arab States and the Europe/CIS is thus catching more and more attention.In implementing this assignment it is crucial to have a deep understanding of what is South-South Cooperation and what is Triangular Cooperation and what makes South-South and Triangular Cooperation relevant and important at the moment.According to the definition provided in the Framework of operational guidelines on United Nations support to South-South and triangular cooperation, South-South Cooperation is a process whereby two or more developing countries pursue their individual and/or shared development objectives through exchanges of knowledge, skills, resources and technical know-how and through collective actions including partnerships involving governments, civil society, academia and the private sector for their individual and/or mutual benefit. The prerequisites for South-South Cooperation are numerous. For example, Northern (developed) and Southern (developing) countries face different geographical, demographical, environmental and political problems. Solutions that have succeeded in countries with similar demographics and similar development context are most likely to be successful in comparable contexts. Knowledge, expertise, knowhow, and solutions unique to the South are usually found within the Global South. All countries, however poor they may be, have effective solutions to offer.South-South Cooperation clearly constitutes a shift from a mono-vector (recipient of knowledge, expertise, other resources) to a multi-vector (both provider and recipient) type of relationship between countries and is based on solidarity, reciprocity, and mutual benefit. Experience shows that countries with the existing policy, coordination mechanism, and resources (including packaged knowledge and expertise, clearly identified needs, and some funding to support exchange in those with other countries) have proven more successful in South-South Cooperation than the countries that revert to South-South Cooperation on an ad hoc basis. Triangular Cooperation involves partnerships between (a) a developed country/countries or a multilateral organization(s) and (b) a Southern partner(s) in development cooperation that work together to implement development cooperation programmes and projects in (c) another Southern partner country/countries. Evidence shows that in many instances, Southern providers of development cooperation require the financial and/or technical support of multilateral and/or developed-country partners in the course of assisting other developing countries. Northern partners also benefit by being able to take advantage of increased institutional capacity in the South and to increase the impact of their aid disbursements by leveraging the resources of multiple Southern partners. A partnership initiative on South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Agricultural Development and Enhanced Food Security (SSTC-ADFS) is jointly supported by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), and the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC). The main focus of the initiative is on further advancing the South-South Cooperation among the participating countries as well as other countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe and Central Asia and beyond through identification, pilot-testing, and documentation of successful models and approaches ready for replication. In doing so, the initiative aims to support the participating countries in achieving their national priorities in agricultural development and enhanced food security. The initiative is implemented in a broader context of poverty alleviation among rural youth and women and improved self-reliance of rural communities in the participating countries, including Algeria, Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia in the Arab States region, and Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey and Uzbekistan in the Europe/CIS. Kazakhstan may join the SSTC-ADFS partnership initiative subject to the decision of the national government counterparts. Within the framework of the initiative the UNOSSC supports demand-driven sharing of technologies and replicating low-cost successful solutions. More particularly, it is envisaged to capitalize on the countries’ achievements though supporting the adoption and replication in the countries of the initiative of the MEVA mobile application that was developed in collaboration between the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of Uzbekistan and USAID within the AgLinks Plus (ALP) Project to address the high demand for horticultural value chain information in Uzbekistan. The development of the application is a solution that provides a “gateway to information” for Uzbek farmers, namely to the in-depth information and tools to support optimal species selection, equipment and input purchasing, integrated pest management, orchard and vineyard management, and investment planning. Information is presented through interactive displays that are complete with pictures, customized “calculators” to support decision-making, safety information, and links to additional resources.

It’s mandate is to create new opportunities for poor people and their communities by increasing access to microfinance and investment capital. Although microfinance global outreach has increased tremendously over the past 30 years, an estimated 2.7 billion people around the world do not use formal financial services. About 56 percent of adults worldwide remain unbanked. Access to financial services, particularly deposit services, underpins the ability of low-income people to achieve sustainable progress on their own terms, enhance their capacities to weather shocks, smooth income streams, and save for the future. Yet providing these services, on a profitable basis, to low-income rural people remains a major challenge for most financial service providers. To provide deposit services to low-income rural people who are currently un- or under-banked in order to enhance their capacities to weather shocks, smooth income streams, and save for the future.Briefly describe the context of the required servicesONE UN in Rwanda developed a joint program called Development and Implementation of Value Chains in Rwanda, whereby UNCDF was tasked to undertake the financial inclusion component. Under this program UNCDF conducted an analysis of the agricultural value-chain financing in Rwanda with the objective to identify key areas of intervention to develop the capacity of FSPs to deliver agriculture financing products.The consultancy process included a Sector Assessment on Agricultural Value-Chain Financing; the identification of potential FSPs partners, institutional gap-assessments of two FSPs as well as development of Technical Assistance and Financial Facilities to implement AVCF products in such FSPs.As output of this process, two (02) FSPs were selected to benefit UNCDF’s Technical Assistance to implement AVCF products: UNGUKA Bank and VFC Ltd. And relevant technical assistance proposal have been developed including proposals for financial facilities.In other hand, notwithstanding the financial inclusion programmes in Rwanda implemented to date (such as BIFSIR 2009-2015), access to finance continues to be a crucial component of the contingent development plans for Rwanda[1] as there is still a large room for improvement. A key issue is matching the supply of financial services better to the demand and another continuing challenge is including people from rural areas into the formal financial system. Therefore, UNCDF and UNDP in partnership with other UN Partners and the Government of Rwanda have agreed to continue supporting inclusive finance, building on best practices and lessons learned from former programmes. The new joint-programme is named Rwanda Financial Inclusion Programme (R-FIP).

The Better Than Cash Alliance is a partnership of governments, companies and international organizations that accelerates the transition from cash to digital payments in order to reduce poverty and drive inclusive growth.Billions of dollars in cash payments and transfers are made daily in emerging and developing economies, including payment of salaries, social welfare and relief, payments to suppliers, remittances, etc. The problems with these cash payments include a lack of transparency, accountability and security, as well as inefficiency. Furthermore, the individuals who receive the cash payments are often part of the 2 billion excluded from the formal financial sector. This means they are excluded from access to a range of appropriate and affordable financial services to help them save safely take advantage of economic opportunities and reduce their vulnerability to risk. Shifting these payments from cash to digital has the potential to improve the lives of low-income people, particularly women, while giving governments, the development community and the private sector a more transparent, time and cost efficient, and often-safer means of disbursing payments.The Better Than Cash Alliance partners with governments, companies, and international organizations that are the key drivers behind the transition to make digital payments widely available by:Advocating for the transition from cash to digital payments in a way that advances financial inclusion and promotes responsible digital finance.Conducting research and sharing the experiences of our members to inform strategies for making the transition.Catalyzing the development of inclusive digital payments ecosystems in member countries to reduce costs, increase transparency, advance financial inclusion-- particularly for women-- and drive inclusive growth The Better Than Cash Alliance (BTCA) is looking to hire a Research Consultant to work on Digital Payments and Digital Government.

It creates new opportunities for poor people and their communities by increasing access to microfinance and investment capital. UNCDF focuses on Africa and the poorest countries of Asia and the Pacific, with a special commitment to countries emerging from conflict or crisis. It provides seed capital C grants and loans C and technical support to help microfinance institutions reach more poor households and small businesses, and local governments finance the capital investments C water systems, feeder roads, schools, irrigation schemes C that will improve poor peoples’ lives.UNCDF works to enlarge peoples’ choices: it believes that poor people and communities should take decisions about their own development. Its programmes help to empower women C over 50% of the clients of UNCDF-supported microfinance institutions are women C and its expertise in microfinance and local development is shaping new responses to food insecurity, climate change and other challenges. UNCDF works in challenging environments C remote rural areas, countries emerging from conflict C and paves the way for others to follow. Its programmes are designed to catalyze larger investment flows from the private sector, development partners and national governments, for significant impact on the Millennium Development Goals, especially Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger, Goal 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women, and Goal 7: Ensure Environmental Sustainability.Despite the rapid growth of the microfinance industry in the past ten years, it is estimated that between two and three billion people still lack access to a broad range of financial products and services on a sustainable basis. The situation is particularly dire in the LDCs, where often more than 90 per cent of the population is denied access to financial services from the formal financial system. UNCDF focuses its strategy on Financial inclusion, which is universal access, at a reasonable cost, to a wide range of financial services, provided by a variety of sound and sustainable institutions. The range of financial services includes savings, short and long-term credit, leasing and factoring, mortgages, insurance, pensions, payments, local money transfers and international remittances.UNCDF manages a number of initiatives related to digital financial (DF). It is in discussion to consolidate the technical assistance and research aspects of these programmes into a single team. This team will serve UNCDF’s needs in regard to DF, particularly for two programmes: Mobile Money for the Poor and the Better than Cash Alliance, but DF also requires support in a number of UNCDF country and global programmes. UNCDF has been active in Nepal in the digital finance space for over a year with funds from UNCDF’s MM4P program laying the groundwork for a full-scale country interventions and programs including MM4P. The preparatory phase of MM4P has been done in consultation with the NRB and with the permission of the Ministry of Finance, with a focus on research, awareness raising, assistance in strategy and business planning and working with the NRB. UNCDF worked in partnership with a single consulting firm during this period to implement a range of activities. UNCDF also received permission from the Government of Nepal (GoN) to expand MM4P activities in Nepal as a focused programme on digital finance and innovation. In addition, to MM4P programme, UNCDF also operates some other programmatic initiative viz UNNATI and Clean Start.Mobile Money for the Poor (MM4P): With support from Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (“DFAT” formerly AusAID) and by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), UNCDF launched Mobile Money for the Poor (MM4P) in March 2012, a global thematic initiative to address the opportunities and challenges of implementing branchless banking and mobile money in challenging markets in Africa and Asia. MM4P’s long-term mission is to help low income and rural households in LDCs increase their financial security through appropriate, affordable and secure means to receive, manage and save money through these digital financial services. MM4P launched in Nepal in 2013 and works closely with other UNCDF programmes, providing both funding and technical oversight for DFS interventions in Nepal. In 2017, MM4P secured a partnership with USAID to continue its activities in Nepal through 2017-2018. MM4P’s overall work in Nepal is managed by it Technical Specialist, Digital Finance (TS DF), based in Kathmandu.

Thease interventions are designed to leverage innovative financial flows from the private sector, national governments and development partners, for maximum impact towards achieving the objectives of the post-2015 agenda. UNCDF discreetly operates two inter-connecting practice areas of; (1) inclusive finance, and (2) local development finance (LDFP).The goals of UNCDFs local development finance practice is to assist municipal authorities develop productive infrastructures and provide inclusive access to sustainable services that contribute towards improving the quality of life of citizens. This concept extends beyond local governance and decentralized provision of services to the spatial, institutional and economic linkages required for comprehensive, inclusive, and sustainable local development. Additionally, LDFP addresses the spectrum of climate change adaptation, food security, education and health, infrastructure, resilient environments, citizen empowerment and representation, and fulfilling and rewarding inclusive economic activity.The UNCDF strategic plan (2014-2017) sets two long term objectives for LDFP these being; (1) Increasing financing for basic services and inclusive growth/local economic development, and (2) establishing effective financing mechanisms to increase resilience to economic and environmental shocks. It is within this frame that the LoOKING diagnostic has been conceptualized and designed .The overall impacts of UNCDFs work in local development finance foresees an expansion of local fiscal space and an increase of fixed capital formation that is either triggered or leveraged by UNCDFs investment and interventions. The underlying concept is to free up domestic financial resources to encourage sustainable local development through effective partnerships. The LoOKING diagnostic establishes an evidence base foundation to aid better local development planning, public investments and to identify leavers for change to enhance social-economic performance of local territories.LoOKING in Papua New GuineaUNDF have historically designed and implemented local development initiatives in a majority of pacific countries at both national and sub-national levels. In particular, being in alignment to its mandate, UNCDF has managed its extensive long-term Pacific engagement via operations in Fiji, PNG, Timor Leste, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu.UNCDF has been developing and testing a holistic diagnostics tool (LoOKING) to innovate local socio-economic development in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in partnership with the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). The associated initiatives are designed to provide a multi-dimensional assessment of local socio-economic potentials in the context of political, fiscal and administrative de-centralization and enhanced public sector investment prioritization.The ‘LoOKING’ diagnostic began its journey in PNG with a team of international and national staff in place, who have been guided by the Regional Technical Adviser and supported by staff from the Regional Office in Bangkok. Presently LoOKING is entering into its final implementation period, whereby the previous years’ work completed is being consolidated and brought to a reporting standard for issue to the beneficiaries. It is anticipated that, based on final reporting sequences, the diagnostic will be possibly scaled out to other areas of the country and islands.The LoOKING pilot project is operational in three Districts namely; (i) Rigo District, (ii) Buka, Bougainville, and (iii) Arawa C Keita, Bougainville. The project provides a diagnostic consisting of four lenses and a series of primary diagnostic tools, methodologies and analysis developed being tested under each separate lens to support local socio-economic development through more effective local government decision making, planning and budgeting in alignment to the post 2015 development agenda. The four interconnecting lenses being; (i) socio-economic territorial scans, (ii) SME and entrepreneurship environments, (iii) public institutions and (iv) local development potentials.The LoOKING pilot has assisted UNCDF local development finance practice to innovate and demonstrate a diagnostics that provided public financial management focus towards a local economic development analysis, factoring in the capacities of local government and the predictability and volume of sub national fiscal transfers. Within the framework of the PIP the following sub analysis works have been completed; (i) Economic Territorial Scans, (ii) SWOT Analysis, (iii) Local Government Values Survey, (iv) Sub National Abridged PEFA, (v) Local Revenue Collection, (vi) econometric modelling for local development potentials and (vii) SME environment scans.Using data collected from each specific analysis and being supplemented with external PNG data the main output has been three local government development prospectuses, each being approximately 20 pages in length. These individual documents as well as provide base data and information offer policy level support to national and sub national governments to assist to create better public-sector investments to support local socioeconomic development.The key national stakeholders for the pilot has been the national government ministries of; (i) finance, (ii) planning and (iii) the treasury and (iv) National Committee on Bougainville Affairs (NCOBA).

These investments are designed to leverage innovative financial flows from the private sector, national governments and development partners, for maximum impact towards inducing sustainable growth and transformative impact via the localization of the SDGs. UNCDF discreetly operates two inter-connecting practice areas of; (1) inclusive finance, and (2) local development finance. The goals of UNCDFs local development finance practice is to assist local governments develop productive infrastructures through innovative financining solutions that include accessing capital markets and PPPs. Through the development of such infrarsture local governments can provide quality services that contribute towards transforming the economic structures of their economies and improving the quality of life of citizens. This concept extends beyond local governance and the decentralized provision of services to the spatial, institutional and economic linkages required for comprehensive development. It additionally addresses the spectrum of climate change adaptation, food security, education and health, infrastructure, resilient environments, citizen empowerment and representation, and fulfilling and rewarding inclusive economic activity.The UNCDF portfolio in ASEANHistorically UNCDF have designed and implemented local development initiatives in a majority of the ASEAN member states both at national and sub-national levels. In particular, in alignment to its mandate, UNCDF has operated in the Least Developed Countries, of the ASEAN region including (1) Cambodia, (2) Laos PDR, and (3) Myanmar.In the area of local development finance in ASEAN, UNCDF is present in Cambodia and Laos PDR, and through the introduction of new projects and the associated programme to this mission will engage in Myanmar. UNCDF have a dedicated project team in ASEAN working alongside the ASEAN Secretariat, national and local government entities and the prvaite sector to promote ASEAN connectivity in allignmnet to the MPAC 2025.The Challenge of Cross-Border DevelopmentThe least developed ASEAN Member States (AMS) represent some of the fastest growing economies in the world. Estimates suggest that growth in Asia and the Pacific is expected to remain steady at 5.5% in 2016 (IMF Regional Economic Outlook, April 2015 issue).Growth within the region will be driven by domestic demand and intra-ASEAN trade and through global exports even though the economic recovery of the wider global economy is estaimated be moderate to weak and remain uneven. The ASEAN region accounts for approximately 40% of the global output but contributes to nearly two thirds of global growth.The inward expansion of the global value chains (GVCs) in Asia has been noticeable and has witnessed the engagement of the CLM-V cluster of countries to engage in lower value activities, whilst the more advanced Asia economies have moved into higher positions on the GVC (upstream) and are capturing a growing share of the GVC-related value added.Although inter-regional trade has increased the level of financial integration across the ASEAN economies remains weak. Only between 20% to 30% of the cross-border investment and banking portfolio is inter-regional. This indicates that the AMS have a tendency to invest more into their “home” country as opposed to neighbours. However, it is witnessed that financial integration increases with trade integration and the size and sophistication of financial systems. Given that Thailand has re-oriented its export policy towards ASEAN and the Asia region in general opportunities arise that support investments through inter-regional financing that specifically boost regional trade. The geographical focal point for such investments will be the cross border economic areas that combine service provision with competitive labour costs.The AMS all are experiencing different patterns of socio-economic growth that are illustrated in the balance of their economies. Growth in most cases is not balanced be it across or within the broad sectors of the economy, geographically, and even amongst different societal groups. Such structural issues present substantial challenges for sustainable and equitable development in Southeast Asia.Research and investments have been targeting the development of inter-regional economic corridors that has resulted in the establishment of a comprehensive overland and maritime transport mechanism to aid the development and installation of regional production networks (RPNs). In the context of the Greater Mekong Sub Region (GMS), cross-border transactions have in general been limited to ease of customs flows, safe storage and distribution, and in some cases the early establishment of special economic zones. Trade exchanges (informal and formal) additionally form and integral part of the cross-border eco-systems.In the GMS and to some extent across the AMS, the cross-border areas represent high potentials for development adopting and utilitizng the features of complementary factor endowment that take advantage of low cost labour and the provision of high quality reliable services that are available or either side of the border area. However, limited activity in terms of productive municipal infrastructure investments is taking place to harness these endowments especially within the CLM country group.UNCDF has developed the Local Uplifting Transformative Solutions (LoTUS) programme in ASEAN, which aims at facilitating investments that take advantage of cross-border locations and factor endowments. Within the framework of this programme UNCDF seeks to create innovative sustainable financial mechanisms to support regional and domestic investments into cross-border areas. Specific emphasis is placed upon promoting cross-border local economic development through the definition of “bundles” of interconnected investments that have maximum impact upon local and regional development. LoTUS will support regional and national policy formulation and the testing of targeted investment mechanisms to support regional integration and development of the border areas.",科学研究,Home based with possible missions to Nay Pyi Taw/Border Areas,22 working days intermittently,up to 2 months,Sep-9-17,"EducationA Master’s degree in Law, Business Law.

By building multi-stakeholder partnerships and leveraging cutting-edge communication technologies, it bridges the gap between elected officials and their constituencies to ensure a transparent dialogue, especially the most marginalized and vulnerable populations. The UN SDG Action Campaign builds upon its previous mandate as the UN Millennium Campaign, which was established in 2002 to support peoples’ participation in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and holding their governments accountable to their commitments.The Campaign has supported the development of the new global sustainability agenda through initiatives such as MY World and the World We Want. 10 million people participated in MY World 2015, making it the largest global survey of our time. The survey gives people a platform to express to world leaders what they want for their future. To help provide context for these big data initiatives, the Campaign coordinates a storytelling portfolio, drawing upon the power of new technologies and innovations to share the stories of the SDGs through the eyes of individuals around the world. These include United Nations Virtual Reality, the Humans of MY World, and partnerships with New Media influencers and influential media companies. Building upon its mandate to amplify the voices of those who are often unheard, particularly the world’s most vulnerable, these initiatives seek to show the human story behind development challenges, allowing people with the power to make a difference have a deeper understanding of their world, and hopefully to act to make a difference.Since 2015, the United Nations SDG Action Campaign has coordinated United Nations Virtual Reality Project, using the power of immersive storytelling to inspire viewers towards increased empathy, action and positive social change. The films provide a deeper understanding for those living in the most complex development challenges, catalyzing urgency for those most in danger of being left behind if the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are not met. It also highlights those already creating solutions to inspire a sense of shared responsibility and collective action, however small. It seeks to capture the common human experiences that individuals face and showcase UN solutions and results that are both uplifting and enduring. It illustrates partnerships with government especially at the local level, and shows how the UN helps meet national priorities through sustainable development. By sharing these VR experiences the SDG Action Campaign is hoping to inspire change that improves peoples’ lives and creates the world we all want.The Humans of MY World seeks to tell the real life stories and top priorities of MY World voters around the world.

The CPD was anchored on three major programme pillars, namely: i) Sustainable Economic Transformation, ii) Justice, Security and Reconciliation and iii) Inclusive Governance and Public Institutions.Within the Economic Transformation Pillar, UNDP support has focused on three major programmes that are fully linked to both the UNDAF and the Agenda for Transformation (AfT). These programmes mainly target issues of capacity building for sustainable economic transformation, private sector development, energy and the environment and natural resource management. For the capacity building for sustainable economic transformation programme, it is anchored to support institutional and human capacity at the national and local levels. This programme seeks to target mainly (a) the continued development of capabilities (knowledge, skills, systems, procedures, targeted actions) for managing national implementation modality with emphasis on capacity and institutional support to key strategic institutions like the MFDP, the PPCC, the LRA, LIPA, LISGIS and the IAA. The second programme is the private sector development programme with a major focus of supporting and establishing a strong private sector that will become the engine of growth for the Liberian economy. This programme seeks to target mainly (b) an inclusive and sustainable economic transformation informed by evidence-based macro-economic policy while at the same time promoting access to livelihood, innovative and competitive private sector and efficient natural resource management. The third one is the energy and environment portfolio that is premised on promoting a safe and healthy environment for all. Its main target is to (c) ensure the reduction of green-house gas, reduce deforestration and climate vulnerability, respond to disaster risk management, water governance and accountability and the sustainability of the environment. The key institutions supported under this program include: the EPA which is the lead institution and national designated authority for the global environmental facility. The EPA provides coordination for all environmental activities across government and benefit from capacity and institutional support. The MoT is another institution housing the early warning system project while the MIA is hosting the disaster risk management project. The E and E portfolio is very huge and diverse and draws on different stakeholders for series of activities under its programme.There is also the EISD which is concerned with the extractive sector and promoting transparency and accountability of natural resources and its management. There are other cros cutting areas like gender, youth initiatives, support to women specific initiatives under key partners.

These included, chiefly, the development and adoption, in September 2015, of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a comprehensive, strategic foundation that commits Member States and the Organization to an ambitious set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and that covers the parallel and often interrelated strands of multilateral engagement across the UN’s collective mandate.The outcomes of the May 2016 World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) further built on the premise of coherence. Most stakeholders agreed on the urgent need to strengthen collaboration and synergies across the “Humanitarian-Development Nexus” (Hum-Dev Nexus) by working to overcome long-standing attitudinal, institutional, and funding obstacles. The WHS reinforced the commitment to establish a ‘New Way of Working’ that can transcend humanitarian and development divides by working over multiple years towards collective outcomes that reduce risk and vulnerability and build towards achievement of the SDGs, based on the comparative advantages of a diverse range of actors, including those outside the UN system.Shortly before WHS, twin resolutions on Sustaining Peace were passed by the Security Council and General Assembly in April 2016, calling on the UN pillars of development, peace and security, and human rights to make contributions to addressing root causes and supporting institutions required for sustainable peace and development.?At present, the UN system remains institutionally fragmented and thematically siloed, which diminishes the Organization’s potential to devise and deliver collective outcomes. This fragmentation is mirrored in the UN’s staff body which, while containing an unparalleled reservoir of specialized expertise, is hampered by a lack of professionals with a system-wide background and requisite skillset. In addition, at country level, the UN is largely lacking dedicated advisory capacity to support joint situation and problem analysis, better joined-up planning and programming towards collective outcomes, and multi-disciplinary support the leadership and coordination by an empowered Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC or DSRSG/RC/HC in integrated contexts). The Secretary-General has made it a priority to achieve greater coherence in the work of the UN both horizontally across siloes, and vertically between the HQs and field C with a particular view to strengthening the UN’s overall effectiveness in prevention. The New Way of Working is one of the initiatives that the Secretary-General views as contributing to this objective.As a contribution to operationalizing the NWOW within the UN system and to overcoming the challenges outlined above as it pertains to its own institutional capacities, UNDP is launching a consultancy to scope of options and parameters of two initiatives:The “People Pipeline” initiative, which seeks to offer a systematic approach to staff development while contributing to organizational reforms aimed at overcoming current barriers to UN system collaboration. It aims to develop and nurture a cadre of professionals across UN system entities starting from the mid-level upward (P3/P4 to D-level) who possess the requisite inter-personal and coordination skills, substantive knowledge and hands-on experience to engage in and facilitate complex system-wide processes. It also aims to align with, and reinforce, existing reform efforts and training/capacity building initiatives to increase UN system coherence and to reduce disincentives that currently prevent closer collaboration and mobility at an organizational and personal level.An initiative on “Deployable advisory capacities” in response to field-identified gaps and requests as a contribution to the system’s ability to deliver on the NWOW at the country level. It evolves from experience deploying Early Recovery Advisors and, in the context of the UNDP’s ongoing evaluation of the global cluster approach to early recovery, aims to identify options for identification of dedicated advisors that can be deployed for up to 12 months to advise RC/HCs and support UN Country Teams and Humanitarian Country Teams with the identification of collective outcomes and development solutions to reduce humanitarian needs, vulnerability and risk.While spearheaded by UNDP, both initiatives are intended to be championed by a broader group of stakeholders that have committed to the NWOW and are expected to be integrated within broader system-wide capacity-building initiatives.

Engage with key operational UN entities as well as OCHA, DOCO, EOSG, DPKO-DFS, DPA, UNSCC and other key partners to further develop the People Pipeline concept and to explore the potential for complementarity with other ongoing training and staff development initiatives.Engage with field practitioners through an informal reference group of planners, advisers and coordination officers and analyze available country evidence to identify key skills gaps and extract examples, lessons and good practices across UN system entities in different UN country configurations that can inform efforts to conceptualize the People Pipeline approach and requirements for development of new skills development/training curricula, as needed.Contextualize the People Pipeline initiative with other UN system efforts such as the revision of the UNDAF guidelines, revision of the Integrated Assessment and Planning (IAP) policy, and the conceptual work underway in defining and operationalizing the NWOW and collective outcomes, and EOSG-led work with the UNSCC on development of training for strategic planners. In addition, contextualize the People Pipeline initiative with ongoing UN system and management reform efforts that seek to increase UN system coherence and reduce institutional and personal disincentives for collaboration and mobility across institutional boundaries.Based on the results of the previous deliverables, design an actionable implementation strategy for the People Pipeline with identified actions for UNDP and recommendations for the wider UN system. This should include benchmarks and timelines, options for possible delivery mechanisms, as well as resource requirements and commitments by stakeholders.Deployable advisory capacities Map and outline capacity requirements and current gaps in capacity available to RC/HCs to implement the NWOW in the field in different country contexts (OCHA presence/no presence, mission/non-mission setting, integrated/non-integrated UN presence etc.).If Identify the cross-cutting and common roles and responsibilities and type of skills that would be required (e.g. at the strategic or operational level; analysis / planning / coordination / IM skills), including considerations regarding division of roles/responsibilities with the RCO and OCHA in different country contexts.Review experience to date with deployment of Early Recovery Advisors and/or similar profiles deployed in support of RC/HCs’ work to operationalize the nexus and NWOW.Engage with key stakeholders such as OCHA, DOCO, the World Bank and key operational agencies to develop options for support to and management of such expertise, ensuring that the initiative does not duplicate existing mechanisms or profiles, complements other on-going processes such as the UN/WB partnership on the humanitarian-development-peace nexus and advancing a collective agenda in-country.Identify applicable HQ-level governance, reporting and management arrangements of the advisor(s) associated with different options (in particular vis-à-vis the RC/HC, RCO and OCHA), including stakeholder priorities, capacities and next steps required.Engage with key stakeholders such as OCHA, DOCO, the World Bank and key operational agencies to explore the option of setting up a community of practice with key stakeholders involved in supporting implementation of the NWOW (TBD in different country contexts, and might include RCOs, OCHA, Early Recovery Advisors, UN Strategic Planners, Heads of Civil Affairs in UN Peacekeeping Operations, Peace and Development Advisors)Resource Mobilization and advocacy for both initiativesA resource mobilization and advocacy strategy will be developed.

Dans le cadre de son mandat de fourniture de capitaux et d’instruments d’investissement, l’UNCDF offre des modèles de financement du ? last mile ? permettant de débloquer les ressources publiques et privées, notamment au niveau national, afin de réduire la pauvreté et d’encourager le développement économique local. L’UNCDF s’appuie sur deux modèles de financement : l’inclusion financière, axée sur l’épargne, qui permet aux individus, aux ménages et aux petites entreprises de participer davantage à l’économie locale, en mettant à leur disposition les outils dont ils ont besoin pour sortir de la pauvreté et gérer leur situation financière ; et les investissements localisés C grace à la décentralisation fiscale, au financement municipal novateur et au financement structuré de projets C, qui contribuent au financement public et privé sous-tendant la croissance économique locale et le développement durable. En renfor?ant l’accessibilité financière des personnes pauvres au niveau des ménages, des petites entreprises et des infrastructures locales, l’UNCDF contribue à la réalisation du premier objectif de développement durable, et le 17e objectif de développement durable, relatif au renforcement des moyens de mise en oeuvre. En identifiant les segments de marché dans lesquels les modèles de financement novateurs peuvent foncièrement faciliter le financement du? last mile ?, l’UNCDF contribue à la réalisation de plusieurs objectifs de développement durable.LoCAL : Le Mécanisme de Financement de l’Adaptation au niveau Local (LoCAL) de l’UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) est un mécanisme qui favorise la prise de conscience, l’intégration de l’adaptation au changement climatique dans les systèmes de planification et de budgétisation des gouvernements locaux de manière participative et sensible au genre et l’augmentation des financements pour l’adaptation à disposition des gouvernements locaux. LoCAL opère à travers des subventions pour la résilience climatique basées sur la performance (SRCBP) qui garantissent la programmation et la vérification des dépenses pour l’adaptation au niveau local. Ces subventions sont combinées à un appui technique et de renforcement des capacités des gouvernements locaux. LoCAL utilise l’effet démonstratif pour attirer vers le niveau local d’autres financements pour l’adaptation, sous forme de transferts budgétaires nationaux additionnels ou de financements issus de sources internationales (par le biais des gouvernements nationaux). LoCAL travaille en trois phases.Phase I C Tester consiste en une évaluation initiale des conditions, suivie par un essai dans deux à quatre gouvernements locaux. Les pays en phase I sont le Ghana, la RDP lao, le Mali, le Mozambique, le Népal, le Niger, la Tanzanie et les Tuvalu.Phase II C Consolider se déroule dans 5 à 10 collectivités locales d’un pays. Elle consiste à recueillir des le?ons et à démontrer l’efficacité du mécanisme à plus grande échelle. Les pays en phase II comprennent le Bangladesh, le Bénin et le Cambodge.Phase III C Systématiser est un déploiement national du LoCAL basé sur les résultats et les enseignements des phases précédentes. Durant cette phase, le mécanisme est progressivement étendu à tous les gouvernements locaux, avec un financement national ou international, et devient le système national pour acheminer le financement pour l’adaptation vers le niveau local. Le financement de la phase III au Bhoutan par l’Union Européenne a été approuvé. Le Cambodge se prépare également à la phase III.Lancée en 2005, la phase pilote de LoCAL Mali est en train de se terminer par l’évaluation annuelle des performances des deux communes pilotes. Le cadre conceptuel a été développé de manière participative et le pays se prépare à étendre le mécanisme à de nouvelles communes (phase II), moyennant mobilisation de ressources complémentaires. Le Mali a sélectionné l’Agence nationale d’investissement des collectivités territoriales (ANICT)en vue d’une accréditation par le Fonds vert pour le climat (GCF), une première étape pour permettre à leurs autorités locales d’accéder à terme à ce financement international climatique pour les mesures d’adaptation au niveau local. Une note conceptuelle pour l’accès direct amélioré a été soumise au FVC en janvier 2017.YouthStart : L’UNCDF a une vision inédite de la finance inclusive dans le sens qu’elle doit s’appuyer sur les marchés financiers des pays moins avancés pour mieux inclure les groupes vulnérables tels que les jeunes. Dans ce contexte, l’UNCDF en 2010 en partenariat avec la Fondation MasterCard et plus récemment avec le SIDA et le gouvernement de Luxembourg a lancé YouthStart, avec l’objectif d’augmenter l’accès aux services financières et de services non-financiers complémentaires pour les jeunes. Entre 2010 et 2015, à travers un pilote régional dans 8 pays de l’Afrique Sub-saharienne, l’UNCDF a mis à l’essai plusieurs stratégies et modèles économiques en vue d’offrir aux jeunes agés de 12 à 24 ans des produits financiers abordables, adaptés et accessibles assortis de services non financiers complémentaires. Les résultats du pilote régional ont été trois fois supérieurs à l’objectif initial du programme pilote, qui était d’ouvrir l’accès aux services financiers à 200 000 jeunes. En décembre 2016, plus de 725 000 jeunes (dont 49 % de jeunes femmes) avaient accès à des services financiers et non financiers. L’évaluation finale du programme pilote YouthStart a relevé que le programme a réellement permis aux jeunes d’accéder à davantage de services financiers et non financiers. En effet, les jeunes participant au programme ont épargné plus de 20 millions de dollars US, et près de 125 000 jeunes entrepreneurs ont pu bénéficier de prêts s’élevant à environ 11 millions de dollars US.UNCDF est en train d’amener le programme dans d’autres pays d’Afrique en s’appuyant sur l’expérience qu’il a acquise dans le cadre d’une démarche axée sur le système de marché, qui détermine les r?les et les relations des principaux acteurs du marché en vue de favoriser la concurrence ou la coopération, et à terme, l’expansion des services financiers et autres destinés aux jeunes. Son approche cible les prestataires de services, les associations professionnelles et le gouvernement, pour renforcer les capacités à l’intérieur des systèmes de marché et favoriser les changements systématiques dans l’ensemble des systèmes.Le Canada adopte une politique d’aide internationale féministe pour promouvoir l’égalité des genres et contribuer au renforcement du pouvoir des femmes et des filles. Pour le Canada, cette approche est la plus efficace pour réduire la pauvreté et batir un monde plus inclusif, plus pacifique et plus prospère.Affaires mondiales Canada consacre dorénavant 15 % de son aide bilatérale en matière d’aide au développement international à la réalisation de projets dédiés à faire avancer l’égalité des genres et à améliorer la qualité de vie des femmes et des filles, notamment les projets qui permettent de lutter contre la violence sexuelle et fondée sur le genre, de soutenir les organisations de femmes qui font la promotion de leurs droits, d'améliorer la capacité institutionnelle du secteur public relativement à l'égalité des genres ainsi qu'à obtenir des données probantes spécifiques aux genres.Le Canada veille à la dignité humaine dans des régions du monde où les populations les plus pauvres et les plus vulnérables ont un accès limité ou inexistant aux services essentiels et certaines doivent composer avec les effets dévastateurs d’un conflit armé ou d’une catastrophe naturelle. Des projets de développement et de l'aide humanitaire d'urgence offriront des soins de santé, notamment sexuelle et reproductive, de l'eau potable, des aliments nutritifs et une éducation de qualité.Le Canada soutient les femmes et les filles afin qu'elles développent leurs compétences, qu'elles accèdent à des postes de décision et qu'elles participent pleinement à la croissance économique de leurs communautés, notamment en soutenant la formation technique et professionnelle et l'entrepreneuriat. Le Canada fait aussi la promotion de l'inclusion sociale, du droit du travail, du droit à la propriété et de l'accès au financement pour les femmes.Le Canada est déterminé à aider les collectivités les plus vulnérables à s’adapter aux changements climatiques, à en atténuer les impacts et, en tirant profit des investissements du secteur privé, à faciliter la transition vers une économie à faible émission en carbone. Le Canada apporte son soutien aux femmes afin d'améliorer la résilience de leurs cultures, leur accès à l’eau et à d’autres ressources naturelles ainsi que leur participation à la prise de décisions en matière d’environnement ainsi qu’au secteur de l’énergie renouvelable.Le Canada croit fermement que la démocratie, la gouvernance responsable, le pluralisme pacifique et les droits de la personne sont des éléments déterminants pour la paix et le développement. Le Canada appuie la gouvernance inclusive en investissant dans la défense des droits des femmes, leur participation à la vie politique, le renforcement de leur pouvoir juridique et leur accès à la justice ainsi qu'en aidant à rendre l’environnement plus favorable à la participation de la société civile.Le Canada est engagé à réduire les menaces, notamment la violence sexuelle et fondée sur le genre, de même qu'à aider à la stabilisation et au développement dans les états fragiles ou touchés par un conflit armé.

The support of United Nations in Tajikistan is arranged through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, which is a strategic programme framework for the period 2016-2020 and was co-signed with the Government of Tajikistan on December 18, 2015. It draws on the full range of expertise and resources of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) to deliver development results, aligned with the priorities reflected in National Development Strategy 2030, Mid-term Development programme 2016-2020 and SDGs 2030.There are six UNDAF Outcomes/Results:People in Tajikistan have their rights protected and benefit from improved access to justice and quality services delivered by accountable, transparent, and gender responsive legislative, executive and judicial institutions at all levels.People in Tajikistan benefit from equitable and sustainable economic growth through decent and productive employment; stable energy supply; improved access to specialized knowledge and innovation and more favorable business environment, especially for entrepreneurs and farmers;People in Tajikistan benefit from quality, equitable and inclusive health, education and social protection systems;The nutritional status of the people in Tajikistan is improved through stable access to sufficient, appropriate and safe food; improved child feeding practices; better water and sanitation and improved access to quality health care;Women, youth, children, persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups are protected from violence, and discrimination, have a voice that is heard and are respected as equal members of society;People in Tajikistan are more resilient to natural and man-made disasters resulting from improved policy and operational frameworks for environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources.These outcomes were identified through an intensive consultation process with Tajikistan’s authorities and UNDAF partners. They serve as a mutual accountability framework between the UN and all development partners in Tajikistan. These outcomes are expected to provide the people of Tajikistan with a fuller range of choices and opportunities to promote their human development, human rights, gender equality and fundamental freedoms. In response to UNDAF implementation 6 Result Groups (including 3 sub-groups in Outcome 3 on Health, Education and Social Protection) were established arranging Chair and Co-Chairing composition from the UN and Government sides to coordinate and work closely with the Government counterparts and other groups towards achieving the UNDAF results. Effectiveness of this set-up very much depends on the effectiveness of the inter-ministerial coordination that needs to facilitate achieving of results. To facilitate planning, reporting, evaluating, M&E approach and data collection, Inter-Agency UNDAF Coordination and M&E Working Group was established to support the Joint Steering Committee in ensuring timely preparation of UNDAF Joint Biannual Work Plans, M&E matrix to track implementation progress, etc. Currently, UNDAF is being implemented within the first round of biannual workplans for 2016-2017 year. During the first year of UNDAF implementation UNDAF Result Groups along with the progress in the UNDAF implementation identified some challenges including the one related to the issue of capacities in M&E (and RBM) on both sides, the UN team and Government representatives in RGs. It was concluded that only consistent representation from the Government side in the Result Groups will allow for capacity development efforts in M&E (and other areas) to be effective and sustainable. Lack of systematic approach to collection and analysis of data at the country level hampers the ability to document, monitor and evaluate progress both nationally and locally while lack of disaggregated data by gender and other social characteristics is an important shortcoming that undermines country’s (and UN system’s) ability to track progress on SDG’s, making sure that “no one is left behind”. Due to the above UNDAF Result Groups have faced challenges in monitoring, evaluating and reporting in a results-based fashion during the preparation of first UNDAF Results report reviewed in May 2017.Taking into the consideration importance of M&E in UNDAF implementation process, need for further capacity building of UN team and Government partners UN Country Team through the UNDAF Coordination and M&E Group is planning to arrange a series of capacity development workshops on M&E in view of supporting effective and efficient UNDAF implementation with adequate linkage to NDS/SDG agenda and ensuring sustainability and ownership of UNDAF results.",科学研究,"home based, with one mission to Dushanbe, Tajikistan",September C November 2017,25 working days (17 working days for homework and 8 working days in Tajikistan),Sep-15-17,"Education:University degree in social sciences, economics and management, and other related areas .

UN Women supports women's economic empowerment in line with these, and with the growing body of evidence that shows gender equality significantly contributes to advancing overall economies and sustainable development in communities and countries.UN Women’s global strategic work plan has established four key outcome areas for women’s economic empowerment including: policies adopted and implemented to strengthen women’s economic empowerment; companies (private and public) promote women’s economic empowerment; gender-responsive services (transport, utilities, markets, water, energy, etc.) to enhance women’s livelihoods; and strengthened coordination of the UN system to the adoption of a common strategy on women’s economic empowerment.With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in September 2015, the critical links between gender and sustainable development and the importance of gender-responsive environmental policy for achieving gender equality is now further articulated. Moreover, key priorities for finance and investment for more sustainable consumption and production will be influenced by the SDGs. It is expected that global, regional and national policy frameworks will be increasingly informed by the SDGs.The Work of UN Women Multi-Country Office C Caribbean 2012-2017The portfolio of support on Economic Empowerment in the UN Women Multi-Country Office for the Caribbean has traditionally focused primarily on child and gender-responsive social protection and advancing decent work for domestic workers. In 2012, the UN Women Multi-Country Office sought to diversify its work in this area and further strengthen its portfolio of work on gender and sustainable development by issuing a regional Call for project proposals focusing on gender-sensitive food security and sustainable development initiatives in the Caribbean that:Supported rural women, small farmers and women entrepreneurs, including agri-business actors, in the context of land rights; agricultural production, food security, livelihoods, natural resource conservation, and climate change;Supported the integration of a gendered approach to food security policy and action plans;Promoted access to green economy opportunities by women, particularly rural and agricultural women producers and women in fisheries; andIncreased the capacity of women to establish or undertake economic enterprises, including green economy initiatives. From 2012 to 2014, the Dominica National Council of Women, with financial support from UN Women Multi-Country Office for the Caribbean supported the Agricultural Women’s Movement in Dominica with the cultivation of two main crops: onions and sorrel.In November 2014, UN Women hired a consultant to undertake an assessment of this and three other projects on gender-sensitive food security and sustainable development. The results of this assessment confirmed that while the short duration of the project did not allow for an assessment of impact, there were short term positive benefits for some women. These benefits included most notably, an increase in income and prospect for ownership of assets, including land. The successes of the project propelled the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Dominica to extend further support to women farmers in the country for onion production. However, the assessment recommended the need for a baseline assessment to support future interventions.In 2016, UN Women supported the conduct of a Gender-Sensitive Value Chain Analysis of Vegetables and Companion Crops. The results of this analysis provided the baseline information needed to inform the development of UN Women’s four-year programme on Gender Equality, Sustainable Development and Decent Work.Informed by the results of the abovementioned analysis, UN Women will be providing support to the Northeast Agricultural Women’s Movement in Dominica with Business Advisory Services with a view to strengthening price and contract negotiation skills and capacities at both individual and group levels; and in order to identify value added potential, as well as, new market opportunities including linkages with the eco-tourism sector and other relevant sectors for the Movement and its members.",科学研究,"Bridgetown,  BARBADOS                      ",45 working days within the period,45 working days within the period,Sep-15-17,"Minimum RequirementsThis consultancy is open to all nationalities including CARICOM nationals.

UNCDF focuses on Africa and the poorest countries of Asia and the Pacific, with a special commitment to countries emerging from conflict or crisis. It provides seed capital C grants and loans C and technical support to help microfinance institutions reach more poor households and small businesses, and local governments finance the capital investments C water systems, feeder roads, schools, irrigation schemes C that will improve poor peoples’ lives.UNCDF works to enlarge peoples’ choices: it believes that poor people and communities should take decisions about their own development. Its programmes help to empower women C over 50% of the clients of UNCDF-supported microfinance institutions are women C and its expertise in microfinance and local development is shaping new responses to food insecurity, climate change and other challenges. UNCDF works in challenging environments C remote rural areas, countries emerging from conflict C and paves the way for others to follow. Its programmes are designed to catalyze larger investment flows from the private sector, development partners and national governments, for significant impact on the Millennium Development Goals, especially Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger, Goal 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women, and Goal 7: Ensure Environmental Sustainability.Despite the rapid growth of the microfinance industry in the past ten years, it is estimated that between two and three billion people still lack access to a broad range of financial products and services on a sustainable basis. The situation is particularly dire in the LDCs, where often more than 90 per cent of the population is denied access to financial services from the formal financial system. UNCDF focuses its strategy on Financial inclusion, which is universal access, at a reasonable cost, to a wide range of financial services, provided by a variety of sound and sustainable institutions. The range of financial services includes savings, short and long-term credit, leasing and factoring, mortgages, insurance, pensions, payments, local money transfers and international remittances.Mobile Money for the Poor (MM4P): In July 2014, MM4P secured a partnership with the MasterCard Foundation (MCF) for the roll out MM4P activities in three additional countries in sub-Saharan Africa for a period of five years (2014 to 2019), including Francophone (Benin, Senegal) and Anglophone (Zambia) Africa. The MCF agreement supposes a significant increase of workload for MM4P especially on the Learning Agenda (see attached).

A large portion of the landscape is now degraded, considering current changes in land use due to expansion of agriculture fields and human settlements, largely driven by high population growth. There is also increasing pressure on the land to accommodate a population that is still rising in the Mt Elgon region and the inherent danger is that this increasing pressure for land will impact negatively on land use, such as a) causing trees to be cut for fuel wood before maturing and b) increase encroachment into the upper protected watersheds c) increased land fragmentation d) increased soil erosion.There is limited knowledge on how to implement Sustainable Land Management (SLM) sustainable forest management (SFM) and climate change mitigation (CCM). There is also limited access to extension services, limited or no innovation in land use management, and no incentives to improve land use practices. Non-application of sustainable land use practices is driven by limited/non-existent practical legislation/laws at both national and District levels. Whereas there are several legislations/laws on SLM and several interventions in place to support SLM, both at national and district levels, degradation of natural resources has continued to be a big challenge. There is also need to identify the gaps hindering/limiting the implementation of the existing legislative interventions in SLM, SFM and CCM. Let alone none existence/weak of community bye-laws on SLM, SFM and CCM, Land tenure issues continues to hinder the furtherance of these practices as well.The Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) with support from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is implementing the project “Integrated Landscape Management for Ecosystem Resilience and Improved Livelihoods in the Mt.

The country is rich in diversified natural forests with a forest cover of nearly 58% of total land area (14,900 square km) of the country. According to FAO, Timor-Leste is losing 1.16% of forests annually or 11,200 ha per year during 1990-2010. The area under plantations has remained stable at 43,000 ha during the period from 2000 to 2010. However, the latest forestry survey conducted by Japan’s Aid3 reported that the annual deforestation rate between 2003 and 2010 is estimated at 1.73% that is much higher than the prediction of FAO. Assuming this alarming trend persisted in the following decades, 17.3% of the forests in the country would have disappeared in 2021 and all forests would have disappeared by 2071. Natural resources play a pivotal role in the lives of people in the Timor-Leste with 75% of the population (140,635) living in rural areas and over 70% employed by the agriculture and forestry sector. The Strategic Development Plan 2011C2030 commits to establishing inclusive development, while the Program of the Fifth Constitutional Government (2012-2017) has set a goal of creating opportunities for all in a fair and inclusive manner. As the Timorese government aspires to transform from subsistence agriculture into a productive and market economy, safeguards must be in place to avoid creating ever increasing economic development and demographic pressure on the natural resource base. A report on the urban, peri-urban and urban associated rural areas of Timor-Leste is currently on the brink of a large-scale fuel poverty crisis.

With notable development partner support nearing a decade, ICS With minor exception, have generally failed to penetrate the market to reach a critical mass production stage in Timor-Leste. The majority of cookstoves makers are in the informal sector with localized sales, substandard quality, and little consistency in stove quality. Previous studies on the ICS sector in Timor-Leste have identified many reasons and/or challenges which can be linked to the failure in the dissemination of ICS. Among them include: Low awareness and lack of knowledge to majority of targeted end-users on fuelwood saving from ICS. This is especially critical in families which still fetch fuelwood for cooking (free fuelwood in municipalities other than Dili.Low awareness and lack of sensitization on the effects of harmful emissions in the smoke to the cooks and babies.High cost of ICS compared to tradition stoves.Lack of business skills, promotion, marketing strategies, and chain actors in the ICS sectorLack of access to finance to establish proper stove production facilitiesHigh material and production costs which lead to high product costMismatch or inappropriate stove designs which does not fit cooks preferences and culture.Lack of clear-cut integrated policy from the government that provides incentives for the commercialization of the ICS sector specificallyLack of large- and medium-scale stove makers and promotersDonor-dependence of existing organizations and NGOs rather than a market based approach. It is evident that existing models needs to be thoroughly looked into for possible modification to eliminate some of the aspects mentioned above, to ensure better penetration of ICS through a market based approach. While the SBEPB project is working on awareness raising and market promotion issues, the technical aspects of existing ICS models remain as a major issue for creating a vibrant ICS market in Timor-Leste.With support from Mercy Corps Timor-Leste, a Cook Stove Center of Excellence within the Dili Institute of Technology (DIT), known as the “Timor-Leste Cook Stove Testing and Knowledge Center,” or TL-CTKC. TL-CTKC opened in July 2013, and facilitated the establishment of a viable market system for the production and sale of Clean Cook Stoves that meet international quality and low-emission standards. However, the centre capacity needs to be thoroughly looked into to ensure that adequate technical and human resources capacity is prevailing at the centre to ensure standardization of all Timor-Leste based ICS models.Specific Tasks:A. Review of existing available models of ICSA comprehensive assessment of the most popular existing models of ICS used in Timor-LesteThis assessment should focus on issues related to production processes and raw materials, quality aspects, emission standards and pricing issues.The assessment should also contextualize Timor-Leste specific issues like level of technical know-how and availability of different raw materials.The assessment should look into, but not limited to the following aspects: manufacturing process and scalability, fuel savings, emission standards, durability, weight and space, cost, portability, safety issues, usability and maintenance aspects, looks and cultural aspects of design.B.

One of the major challenges for Timor-Leste is to pursue economic development without creating additional burdens on natural resources thereby preserving ecosystems that are critical to maintaining the quality of life and providing environmental services to society. The country is rich in diversified natural forests with a forest cover of nearly 58% of total land area (14,900 square km) of the country. According to FAO, Timor-Leste is losing 1.16% of forests annually or 11,200 ha per year during 1990-2010. The area under plantations has remained stable at 43,000 ha during the period from 2000 to 2010. However, the latest forestry survey conducted by Japan’s Aid3 reported that the annual deforestation rate between 2003 and 2010 is estimated at 1.73% that is much higher than the prediction of FAO. Assuming this alarming trend persisted in the following decades, 17.3% of the forests in the country would have disappeared in 2021 and all forests would have disappeared by 2071. Natural resources play a pivotal role in the lives of people in the Timor-Leste with 75% of the population (140,635) living in rural areas and over 70% employed by the agriculture and forestry sector. The Strategic Development Plan 2011C2030 commits to establishing inclusive development, while the Program of the Fifth Constitutional Government (2012-2017) has set a goal of creating opportunities for all in a fair and inclusive manner. As the Timorese government aspires to transform from subsistence agriculture into a productive and market economy, safeguards must be in place to avoid creating ever increasing economic development and demographic pressure on the natural resource base. A report on the urban, peri-urban and urban associated rural areas of Timor-Leste is currently on the brink of a large-scale fuel poverty crisis. Internal migration to urban areas (specifically the capital Dili), poor enforcement of legislation and widespread poverty are some of the main contributing factors to fuel poverty and degraded natural resources. These trends are rapidly heading towards a state where over-extraction and insufficient re-planting of trees is threatening both people’s ability to afford fuel wood for cooking and their ability to easily attain it in other ways. Coupled with this humanitarian issue, the deforestation and forest degradation that occur as a symptom of people’s reliance on wood fuel (+90% of the population) is threatening the sustainability of the natural environment and its ability to perform ecological services in and around Dili. Project DescriptionTargeted to address the above mentioned problems, the Sustainable Bioenergy Production from Biomass (SBEPB) Project with the support of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Government of Timor-Leste (GoTL) the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other funding partners focuses on the promotion and use of biomass energy resources for the provision of energy access and services in rural areas. Overall, the Project is expected to result in a reduction of annual biomass/fuel wood consumption in Timor-Leste through the gradual utilization of biomass-based energy systems and efficiency improvements in the rural areas of the country as influenced by the Project. The Project will facilitate the widespread application of biomass-based energy systems, particularly for economic and social uses in the country’s rural areas. The reduction of GHG emissions through the use of more efficient fuel wood technologies and sustainable biomass energy generation in the country will contribute to global GHG emission reductions. SBEPB project is a four-year program contributing to the reduction of greenhouse emissions through removal of barriers to sustainable production and utilization of biomass resources in Timor-Leste and application of biomass energy technologies to support local economic, environmental and social development. The objective of the project is designed to achieved through enhancing the capacity of all relevant public and private stakeholders, developing policy and legal bioenergy frameworks for the promotion of energy efficient and low carbon end-use appliances and scaling up of 20,000 improved cook stoves (ICS) in the country. The project is assisting the Government of Timor-Leste in mainstreaming sustainable biomass energy in policy formulation and consequently helping in mitigating the national emission of greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation and the use of non-renewable biomass. The project is envisioned to increase Timor-Leste’s access to clean bioenergy and also create employment through inclusive businesses.Based on the above strategic considerations, the Project focuses on three major components:Component 1: Policy and Institutional Support for Deployment and Commercialization of Advanced Bio-energy Technologies.

Incomplete and late applications will not be considered.",UNDP,English,http://www.undp.org/,International Consultant,联合国开发计划署,"Based on Timor-Leste’s National Strategic Plan (2011-30), the country have a total of 6 MW biomass energy potential. Fuel wood remains as the major source of energy consumption in the household and small cottage industry level. Apart from fuel wood, other potential sources of biomass energy includes: crop residues like rice husk, coffee husk; animal dung and municipal solid waste (MSW). Crop residues are a large biomass resource especially in the countryside where they are produced as by-products of harvesting and processing of agricultural crops, principally paddy, maize and coffee. MSW has become a major source in large urban areas, principally Dili C the capital of Timor-Leste. In other municipalities, MSW and animal dung is comparatively a smaller portion of the biomass resources.The key cottage industries using inefficient technologies and biomass resources includes: tofu/tempe making, salt making, bakeries, coffee roasting and local restaurants. Private sector development is a key engine of economic growth and crucial to reducing poverty, as underlined in Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan: ‘The future sustainability of the economy of our nation depends upon building a mature private sector’. While the Government of Timor-Leste is committed to develop a market-led economy with the private sector as the primary engine of growth, the nascent Timorese private sector has so far been unable to spur sufficient economic development for the rapidly increased population. Despite Government efforts and the recent considerable injection of resources into the real economy, in practice, ill-equipped Timorese Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) continue to face a number of constraints that limit the sector’s overall growth. This is particularly evident in rural areas where poverty incidence is high and rural-to-urban migration poses a major challenge and poorer people remain excluded from the mainstream economy. An estimated one third of the population remains outside of the cash economy (formal and informal) and market access remains very limited in most rural areas of the country. Improving the investment climate and market access provides new employment and income opportunities to both men and women. At the same time, this strategy reaffirms the importance of women entrepreneurs as engines of growth for the economy in generating employment, driving production and innovation, and contributing to local development and it aims therefore to design specific interventions to help women in Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs), including start-ups and microenterprises, to address commonly cited challenges faced to start and grown their businesses. Access to finance and credit services has been found as one of the top five constraints for micro and small entrepreneurs. This is also highly applicable for micro and small entrepreneurs involved and potentially eager to get involved in biomass energy businesses. The project intends to design appropriate financial products and services, preferably a loan guarantee scheme with potential financial institutions (eg, BNCTL, Moris Rasik, Tuba Rai Metin) to support SMEs interested in stove/furnace manufacturing and its value chain business. This will include scoping of the right financial institution, design of the financial product and mechanism for continuation beyond the project life. Specific Tasks:A. Identifying and conceptualizing financial instruments for bio-energy promotionA supply side analysis: stocktaking of financial instruments and initiatives which can be relevant to bio-energy promotion in Timor-Leste.A demand side analysis: understanding the financing needs of the bio-energy businesses in Timor-Leste. B.

Le pays compte dix régions, un district, 49 cercles et 703 communes (dont 666 rurales). Le nord du pays compte les régions de Gao, Kidal, Tombouctou, Ménaka et Taoudénit et le sud du pays les régions de Kayes, Koulikoro, Mopti, Ségou, Sikasso, et le district de Bamako.Depuis plus de trois (3) décennies, le Mali est affecté de manière très significative par les phénomènes climatiques qui perturbent les activités économiques. En effet, la majorité de la population dépend fortement de l’exploitation des ressources naturelles, notamment à travers les activités agro-sylvo-pastorales tributaires de la pluviométrie dont les fluctuations sont difficilement prévisibles. La nature aléatoire de la pluviométrie se manifeste par les tendances à la baisse et la variabilité de la pluviométrie dans l’espace. En outre, les régions du Mali connaissent une augmentation des inondations ainsi qu’un accroissement de l’évaporation et de l’assèchement des zones humides et autres plans d’eau en raison des fortes températures et vents violents. La dégradation des sols et l’érosion hydrique sont permanentes, et les terres arables se réduisent progressivement à cause de la déforestation et de la désertification.Afin de lutter efficacement et de manière durable contre les impacts des risques climatiques, le Gouvernement du Mali a élaboré en 2007, le Plan d’Action National d’Adaptation aux changements climatiques (PANA) qui identifie les priorités nationales en matière d’adaptation et les classes en fonction de la vulnérabilité aux risques climatiques. La mise en ?uvre du projet ? Renforcement de la Résilience des Groupes de Femmes productrices et des Communautés Vulnérables aux Changements Climatiques au Mali ? ou ? Projet Mali-Femmes ?constitue une réponse aux besoins urgents et immédiats d’adaptation identifiés dans le PANA et s’inscrit en droite ligne de la politique Nationale sur les Changements Climatiques (PNCC) visant à accro?tre la résilience des communautés locales face aux impacts des risques climatiques au Mali.Le projet ? Renforcement de la Résilience des Groupes de Femmes productrices et des Communautés Vulnérables aux Changements Climatiques au Mali ? dénommé Projet Mali-Femmes a démarré ses activités en ao?t 2015.Les zones d’intervention du projet se situent dans dix (10) communes des régions de Kayes (Sero Diamanou, Bema et Yéréré), Koulikoro (Kiban, Boron et Sagabala), et Sikasso (Bougoula-Hameau, Tella, Yorosso et Sincina-Nampossela).

The objectives of the terminal evaluation are to assess the achievement of project results, and to draw lessons that can both improve the sustainability of benefits from this project, and aid in the overall enhancement of UNDP programming. The project mid-term evaluation (MTE) took place in late 2015 (final report submitted in early 2016). The final evaluation should assess the extent to which the recommendations of the mid-term review have been taken into account by the project.The terminal evaluation will explore in detail five major criteria:Relevance: the extent to which the activity is suited to local and national development priorities and organizational policies, including changes over time;Effectiveness: the extent to which an objective has been achieved or how likely it is to be achieved;Efficiency: the extent to which results have been delivered with the least costly resources possible;Results: the positive and negative, and foreseen and unforeseen, changes to and effects produced by a development intervention. In GEF terms, results include direct project outputs, short- to medium-term outcomes, and longer-term impacts including global environmental benefits, replication effects and other local effects;Sustainability: the likely ability of an intervention to continue to deliver benefits for an extended period after completion. Projects need to be environmentally as well as financially and socially sustainable.The following project impacts will be assessed during the terminal evaluation:Perceptions on the “Situation at the end of the Project”, specifically focusing on how the project has influenced changes in the situation over the course of the project lifetime;Nature and scale of the policy impact made by the project on federal and regional policies, regulations, institutional arrangements related to increase of low emission vehicles usage and development of SUT projects in Russia, if any, on relevant departments of the government or other policy making bodies;Extent of effectiveness of capacity building initiatives undertaken under the aegis of the project;Appropriateness and effectiveness of the institutional arrangement deployed in the project with alternative scenarios, if any;Details of co-funding, if any, leveraged by the project and its impact on the project achievements;The effectiveness of monitoring and overseeing systems such as project steering committee and suggestion of improvements, if any, and consideration of how well the project has done adaptive management. Evaluation approach and methodAn overall approach and method for conducting project terminal evaluations of UNDP supported GEF financed projects has developed over time. The criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and impact, as defined and explained in the UNDP guidance for conducting terminal evaluations of UNDP-supported, GEF-financed projects are to be used for evaluation. A set of questions covering each of these criteria have been drafted and are to be amended, completed and submitted with the matrix as part of an evaluation inception report, and included as an annex to the final report. The evaluation must provide evidence-based information that is credible, reliable and useful. The evaluation team is expected to follow a participatory and consultative approach ensuring close engagement with government counterparts, in particular the GEF operational focal point, National Project Director, UNDP Project Support Office, project team, UNDP GEF Technical Adviser based in Istanbul and other key stakeholders.

Even relatively modest measures to reduce fossil fuel imports therefore have the potential to significantly enhance Mauritius’s energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This fact is recognised in the Government’s Long-Term Energy Strategy 2009-2025, which explicitly recognises energy efficiency and energy conservation as priority strategies to deal with the country’s energy and environmental challenges, particularly as the country’s major source of renewable energy, bagasse (which accounts for 20% of Mauritian electricity generation and 89% of renewable electricity generation), is intrinsically unscalable due to land constraints and seasonal availability. The Strategy contains a target of improving overall energy efficiency by 6% by 2020 relative to a 2008 baseline. To do so, the Strategy envisages creating “a pool of qualified and certified energy auditors and an appropriate energy auditor certification scheme”.The rationale of the GEF project is to assist EEMO to operationalise the mandatory energy audit scheme for large energy consumers by addressing and removing technical, institutional and financial barriers to the adoption of energy efficiency measures and, at the same time, capitalise on the synergies in the RAC sector around ODS emissions reductions and HFC avoidance. The components of the project are therefore aligned with barriers, and are designed to inter-lock in a coordinated manner.Component 1 seeks to support the operationalization of the national EE audit programme, specifically by developing an implementation roadmap agreed to by all stakeholders, and by linking the EE programme to the Government’s parallel efforts under the HPMP. The concept of the roadmap has been welcomed by the private sector ans is seen as a key engagement tool.Component 2 strengthens the EE programme’s engagement with RAC and steam systems due to their central importance in EE efforts and the relatively complex nature of these systems.Component 3 addresses the financing barrier confronting the EE programme by developing a dedicated credit line for firms that are willing to invest in EE equipment and systems given the appropriate incentives and facilities.Component 4 establishes the quality standards (ISO 50001 and related ISO standards) that will underlie the EE programme, as well as the ability of national stakeholders to apply and certify these standards.Component 5 seeks to diffuse the benefits from the EE programme more broadly across the manufacturing sector, giving smaller companies access to information and technical know-how in areas that are relevant to them albeit on a smaller scale.The Project Identification Form (PIF) for the project was approved under the Climate Change Mitigation GEF Trust Fund allocation on 28 April 2017. In order to reach the stage of UNDP Project Document completion and CEO endorsement, project development includes a preparatory phase, which foresees the collection of information and gathering of useful data for project design, the validation of the indicative outcomes and outputs contained in the PIF, the development of a full M&E plan including appropriate indicators and baseline, a participatory plan to involve communities as well as the identification of implementing partners and negotiation pertaining to implementation arrangements and co-financing.The Project Preparation Grant (PPG) was approved by the GEF Secretariat to prepare a Full-Size Project Document (FSP) for submission under the GEF-6 STAR. In this context a Policy, Legal and Institutional Specialist is required to prepare the FSP, focusing on all components proposed in the PIF, and expected outcomes to be achieved, as outlined in the approved Project Identification Form (PIF). The Request for GEF CEO Endorsement and the UNDP Project Document plus ancillary documentation must therefore be nationally validated and finalized for internal UNDP clearance no later than 31 March 2018.

Even relatively modest measures to reduce fossil fuel imports therefore have the potential to significantly enhance Mauritius’s energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This fact is recognised in the Government’s Long-Term Energy Strategy 2009-2025, which explicitly recognises energy efficiency and energy conservation as priority strategies to deal with the country’s energy and environmental challenges, particularly as the country’s major source of renewable energy, bagasse (which accounts for 20% of Mauritian electricity generation and 89% of renewable electricity generation), is intrinsically unscalable due to land constraints and seasonal availability. The Strategy contains a target of improving overall energy efficiency by 6% by 2020 relative to a 2008 baseline. To do so, the Strategy envisages creating “a pool of qualified and certified energy auditors and an appropriate energy auditor certification scheme”.The rationale of the GEF project is to assist EEMO to operationalise the mandatory energy audit scheme for large energy consumers by addressing and removing technical, institutional and financial barriers to the adoption of energy efficiency measures and, at the same time, capitalise on the synergies in the RAC sector around ODS emissions reductions and HFC avoidance. The components of the project are therefore aligned with barriers, and are designed to inter-lock in a coordinated manner.Component 1 seeks to support the operationalization of the national EE audit programme, specifically by developing an implementation roadmap agreed to by all stakeholders, and by linking the EE programme to the Government’s parallel efforts under the HPMP. The concept of the roadmap has been welcomed by the private sector ans is seen as a key engagement tool.Component 2 strengthens the EE programme’s engagement with RAC and steam systems due to their central importance in EE efforts and the relatively complex nature of these systems.Component 3 addresses the financing barrier confronting the EE programme by developing a dedicated credit line for firms that are willing to invest in EE equipment and systems given the appropriate incentives and facilities.Component 4 establishes the quality standards (ISO 50001 and related ISO standards) that will underlie the EE programme, as well as the ability of national stakeholders to apply and certify these standards.Component 5 seeks to diffuse the benefits from the EE programme more broadly across the manufacturing sector, giving smaller companies access to information and technical know-how in areas that are relevant to them albeit on a smaller scale.The Project Identification Form (PIF) for the project was approved under the Climate Change Mitigation GEF Trust Fund allocation on 28 April 2017. In order to reach the stage of UNDP Project Document completion and CEO endorsement, project development includes a preparatory phase, which foresees the collection of information and gathering of useful data for project design, the validation of the indicative outcomes and outputs contained in the PIF, the development of a full M&E plan including appropriate indicators and baseline, a participatory plan to involve communities as well as the identification of implementing partners and negotiation pertaining to implementation arrangements and co-financing.The Project Preparation Grant (PPG) was approved by the GEF Secretariat to prepare a Full-Size Project Document (FSP) for submission under the GEF-6 STAR. In this context, a Monitoring and Evaluation Expert is required to prepare the FSP, focusing on all components proposed in the PIF, and expected outcomes to be achieved, as outlined in the approved Project Identification Form (PIF). The Request for GEF CEO Endorsement and the UNDP Project Document plus ancillary documentation must therefore be nationally validated and finalized for internal UNDP clearance no later than 31 March 2018.

The objectives of the terminal evaluation are to assess the achievement of project results, and to draw lessons that can both improve the sustainability of benefits from this project, and aid in the overall enhancement of UNDP programming. The project mid-term evaluation (MTE) took place in late 2015 (final report submitted in early 2016). The final evaluation should assess the extent to which the recommendations of the mid-term review have been taken into account by the project.The terminal evaluation will explore in detail five major criteria:Relevance: the extent to which the activity is suited to local and national development priorities and organizational policies, including changes over time;Effectiveness: the extent to which an objective has been achieved or how likely it is to be achieved;Efficiency: the extent to which results have been delivered with the least costly resources possible;Results: the positive and negative, and foreseen and unforeseen, changes to and effects produced by a development intervention. In GEF terms, results include direct project outputs, short- to medium-term outcomes, and longer-term impacts including global environmental benefits, replication effects and other local effects;Sustainability: the likely ability of an intervention to continue to deliver benefits for an extended period after completion. Projects need to be environmentally as well as financially and socially sustainable. Evaluation approach and methodAn overall approach and method for conducting project terminal evaluations of UNDP supported GEF financed projects has developed over time. The criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and impact, as defined and explained in the UNDP guidance for conducting terminal evaluations of UNDP-supported, GEF-financed projects are to be used for evaluation. A set of questions covering each of these criteria have been drafted and are to be amended, completed and submitted with the matrix as part of an evaluation inception report, and included as an annex to the final report. The evaluation must provide evidence-based information that is credible, reliable and useful. The terminal evaluation should include a mixed methodology of document review, interviews, and observations from project site visits.The evaluation team is expected to follow a participatory and consultative approach ensuring close engagement with government counterparts, in particular the GEF operational focal point, National Project Director, UNDP Project Support Office, project team, UNDP GEF Technical Adviser based in Istanbul and other key stakeholders. Interviews will be held with the following organizations at a minimum: UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub, UNDP-Russia Projects Support Office, Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, administrations of pilot cities (Kazan, Kaliningrad), Federal State Institution “Research Center for Complex Transport Projects of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation”, OJSC “Scientific and Research institute of motor transport”, Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University (MADI), Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy Studies of the National Research University ""Higher School of Economics"", municipal institution "" Organizer of passenger transportations"" (the largest bus public transport operator in Kazan), administrations of pilot replication cities. The evaluation team should also speak with the key international and national consultants of the project including the international consultant who designed and wrote the project document, the project mid-term evaluator and the project international CTA.A list of persons and organizations for interviews will be proposed by the project team and should be agreed upon at least 1 week prior to the mission to the Russian Federation. The international evaluator can request additional meetings/interviews if required. UNDP and NIM partner should be informed of additionally requested interviews/meetings and the dialogue with the evaluated party should be handled in an inclusive and transparent manner.The international evaluator will review all relevant sources of information, such as project document, project reports C including annual APR/PIR, project budget revisions, MTR and progress reports, GEF focal area tracking tools, project files, national strategic and legal documents, reports of contractors and sub-contractors, reports of the international CTA, reports of the national consultant, and any other materials that the evaluator considers useful for this evidence-based assessment. Evaluation criteria & ratingsAssessment of project performance will be carried out against expectations set out in the Project Logical Framework/Results Framework, which provides performance and impact indicators for project implementation along with their corresponding means of verification. The evaluation will at a minimum cover the criteria of: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact. Ratings must be provided on the following performance criteria:Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E design at entry, M&E plan implementation, overall quality of M&E); IA&EA Execution (Quality of UNDP implementation, quality of execution - executing agency, overall quality of implementation/execution);Assessment of Outcomes (Relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, overall project outcome rating);Sustainability (Financial resources, socio-political, institutional framework and governance, environmental, overall likelihood of sustainability).The completed table must be included in the evaluation executive summary. Project finance/co-financeThe evaluation will assess the key financial aspects of the project, including the extent of co-financing planned and realized. Project cost and funding data will be required, including annual expenditures. Variances between planned and actual expenditures will need to be assessed and explained. Results from recent financial audits, as available, should be taken into consideration. The evaluator will receive assistance from the Project Support Office and project team to obtain financial data in order to complete the co-financing table, which will be included in the terminal evaluation report. ImpactThe evaluator will assess the extent to which the project is achieving impacts or progressing towards the achievement of impacts. Key findings that should be brought out in the evaluations include whether the project has demonstrated:verifiable improvements in ecological status;verifiable reductions in stress on ecological systems; demonstrated progress towards these impact achievements.Conclusions, recommendations & lessonsThe evaluation report must include a chapter providing a set of conclusions, recommendations and lessons learned.

Even relatively modest measures to reduce fossil fuel imports therefore have the potential to significantly enhance Mauritius’s energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This fact is recognised in the Government’s Long-Term Energy Strategy 2009-2025, which explicitly recognises energy efficiency and energy conservation as priority strategies to deal with the country’s energy and environmental challenges, particularly as the country’s major source of renewable energy, bagasse (which accounts for 20% of Mauritian electricity generation and 89% of renewable electricity generation), is intrinsically unscalable due to land constraints and seasonal availability. The Strategy contains a target of improving overall energy efficiency by 6% by 2020 relative to a 2008 baseline. To do so, the Strategy envisages creating “a pool of qualified and certified energy auditors and an appropriate energy auditor certification scheme”.The rationale of the GEF project is to assist EEMO to operationalise the mandatory energy audit scheme for large energy consumers by addressing and removing technical, institutional and financial barriers to the adoption of energy efficiency measures and, at the same time, capitalise on the synergies in the RAC sector around ODS emissions reductions and HFC avoidance. The components of the project are therefore aligned with barriers, and are designed to inter-lock in a coordinated manner.Component 1 seeks to support the operationalization of the national EE audit programme, specifically by developing an implementation roadmap agreed to by all stakeholders, and by linking the EE programme to the Government’s parallel efforts under the HPMP. The concept of the roadmap has been welcomed by the private sector ans is seen as a key engagement tool.Component 2 strengthens the EE programme’s engagement with RAC and steam systems due to their central importance in EE efforts and the relatively complex nature of these systems.Component 3 addresses the financing barrier confronting the EE programme by developing a dedicated credit line for firms that are willing to invest in EE equipment and systems given the appropriate incentives and facilities.Component 4 establishes the quality standards (ISO 50001 and related ISO standards) that will underlie the EE programme, as well as the ability of national stakeholders to apply and certify these standards.Component 5 seeks to diffuse the benefits from the EE programme more broadly across the manufacturing sector, giving smaller companies access to information and technical know-how in areas that are relevant to them albeit on a smaller scale.The Project Identification Form (PIF) for the project was approved under the Climate Change Mitigation GEF Trust Fund allocation on 28 April 2017. In order to reach the stage of UNDP Project Document completion and CEO endorsement, project development includes a preparatory phase, which foresees the collection of information and gathering of useful data for project design, the validation of the indicative outcomes and outputs contained in the PIF, the development of a full M&E plan including appropriate indicators and baseline, a participatory plan to involve communities as well as the identification of implementing partners and negotiation pertaining to implementation arrangements and co-financing.The Project Preparation Grant (PPG) was approved by the GEF Secretariat to prepare a Full-Size Project Document (FSP) for submission under the GEF-6 STAR. In this context, a Gender Specialist is required to prepare the FSP, focusing on all components proposed in the PIF, and expected outcomes to be achieved, as outlined in the approved Project Identification Form (PIF). The Request for GEF CEO Endorsement and the UNDP Project Document plus ancillary documentation must therefore be nationally validated and finalized for internal UNDP clearance no later than 31 March 2018.

BACKGROUNDSpread across 175,000 km2 of the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Western Himalayan mountain ranges, northern Pakistan is a rich storehouse of global biodiversity. Populations of many globally threatened species are still found here, from snow leopard and lynx to the highly endangered Woolly Flying Squirrel. Although protected areas now cover some 11% of the mountains, and community co-managed conservancies a further 12%, threats remain to the region’s unique biodiversity, due to poverty and limited options for sustainable sources of livelihood. The project will use voluntary certification of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) as a tool to promote biodiversity conservation and strengthen existing conservation efforts with innovative market-based mechanisms. The project will develop community and institutional capacity for certified production of ‘biodiversity-friendly’ NTFPs in northern Pakistan and stimulate market demand for biodiversity friendly NTFP thereby creating new economic incentives for conservation.2. MAIN OBJECTIVES, RESPONSABILITIES AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ANALYTICAL WORK.The project’s objective is the Sustainable production of biodiversity goods and services through community ecosystem-based enterprises in demonstration conservancies in the northern mountains of Pakistan. This objective is being achieved through the following four outcomes: Outcome 1: Market demand for biodiversity friendly non-timber forest products (NTFPs) stimulatedOutcome 2: Strengthened capacity of local communities to produce and market biodiversity friendly productsOutcome 3: Positive biodiversity linkages strengthened at landscape level through CBE Conservation and Sustainable Resource Use (SRU) AgreementsOutcome 4: Strengthen institutional capacity for scale up and replication of CBEsThe project seeks to create market-based incentives to address threats to biodiversity in northern Pakistan arising from the unsustainable commercial exploitation of NTFP. The project focuses on supply chain management, including the development of voluntary certification systems for selected NTFP, strengthening producer capacity to comply with certification standards, stimulating market demand for certified biodiversity-friendly NTFP and increasing access to markets.The geographic scope of the project includes two provinces: Gilgit-Baltistan (Chilas and Astore conservancies) and Khyber-Paktunkhwa (Upper Swat and upper Dir conservancies). These sites were identified on the basis of their strong potential, previous engagement of the executing/implementing agencies and set criteria of social, biological and administrative set up.The Project Management Unit is based in Islamabad and is supported by two field offices in the pilot areas, with two field managers, who coordinated the planning, implementation and monitoring with local community based organizations, NGO’s and the district and provincial authorities.Ministry of Climate Change, Government of Pakistan is the implementing Partner and has the overall responsibility of implementing the project on the ground with support from UNDP (Executing Agency) and provincial line departments and IUCN-Pakistan (Responsible Partners).The Terminal Evaluation (TE) will be conducted according to the guidance, rules and procedures established by UNDP and Global Environment Facility (GEF) as reflected in the UNDP Evaluation Guidance for GEF Financed Projects.The objectives of the evaluation are to assess the achievement of project results, and to draw lessons that can improve the sustainability of benefits from this project, map the overall contribution of the project towards the conservation and sustainable use agenda of the government of Pakistan, and aid in the overall enhancement of UNDP programming.3.

La proposition complète a été soumise à l’examen du comité de revue des projets (PPRC) lors de la 18ème réunion du Fonds et a été approuvée. Le document du programme a été signé en fin 2015 par le Directeur Pays du PNUD, le Ministre de l’Environnement, de l’Assainissement et du Développement Durable et le Ministre de la Coopération Internationale et des Affaires Etrangères.Le projet a été officiellement lancé le 04 mars 2016 pour une durée de trois ans. Dans ses dispositions de suivi-évaluation, il est prévu une évaluation mi-parcours dans sa deuxième année de mise en ?uvre et une évaluation finale en troisième année. Cette revue à mi-parcours est prévue d’ici décembre 2017.En 2016, le PACV-MT a réalisé une situation de référence principalement axée sur l’état des cibles car le projet a pris du retard pour sa mise en ?uvre à cause de la situation politico-sécuritaire dans le pays. Aujourd’hui, nous constatons que certains indicateurs et cibles du cadre logique nécessitent un recadrage compte tenu de l’environnement socio-économique et politique actuel de la zone d’intervention du projet.Le système de suivi-évaluation du projet représente un enjeu important et indispensable pour pouvoir mieux suivre les actions, apprécier et capitaliser les changements qui vont s’opérer pendant et après la durée du programme conformément au cadre logique.Ainsi, le PACV-MT, sous tutelle du Ministère de l’Environnement, de l’Assainissement et du Développement Durable (MEADD) à travers l’Agence de l’Environnement et du Développement Durable (AEDD), sollicite l’expertise d’un consultant pour appuyer l’équipe du projet à mieux harmoniser son cadre logique.

Even relatively modest measures to reduce fossil fuel imports therefore have the potential to significantly enhance Mauritius’s energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This fact is recognised in the Government’s Long-Term Energy Strategy 2009-2025, which explicitly recognises energy efficiency and energy conservation as priority strategies to deal with the country’s energy and environmental challenges, particularly as the country’s major source of renewable energy, bagasse (which accounts for 20% of Mauritian electricity generation and 89% of renewable electricity generation), is intrinsically unscalable due to land constraints and seasonal availability. The Strategy contains a target of improving overall energy efficiency by 6% by 2020 relative to a 2008 baseline. To do so, the Strategy envisages creating “a pool of qualified and certified energy auditors and an appropriate energy auditor certification scheme”.The rationale of the GEF project is to assist EEMO to operationalise the mandatory energy audit scheme for large energy consumers by addressing and removing technical, institutional and financial barriers to the adoption of energy efficiency measures and, at the same time, capitalise on the synergies in the RAC sector around ODS emissions reductions and HFC avoidance. The components of the project are therefore aligned with barriers, and are designed to inter-lock in a coordinated manner.Component 1 seeks to support the operationalization of the national EE audit programme, specifically by developing an implementation roadmap agreed to by all stakeholders, and by linking the EE programme to the Government’s parallel efforts under the HPMP. The concept of the roadmap has been welcomed by the private sector ans is seen as a key engagement tool.Component 2 strengthens the EE programme’s engagement with RAC and steam systems due to their central importance in EE efforts and the relatively complex nature of these systems.Component 3 addresses the financing barrier confronting the EE programme by developing a dedicated credit line for firms that are willing to invest in EE equipment and systems given the appropriate incentives and facilities.Component 4 establishes the quality standards (ISO 50001 and related ISO standards) that will underlie the EE programme, as well as the ability of national stakeholders to apply and certify these standards.Component 5 seeks to diffuse the benefits from the EE programme more broadly across the manufacturing sector, giving smaller companies access to information and technical know-how in areas that are relevant to them albeit on a smaller scale.The Project Identification Form (PIF) for the project was approved under the Climate Change Mitigation GEF Trust Fund allocation on 28 April 2017. In order to reach the stage of UNDP Project Document completion and CEO endorsement, project development includes a preparatory phase, which foresees the collection of information and gathering of useful data for project design, the validation of the indicative outcomes and outputs contained in the PIF, the development of a full M&E plan including appropriate indicators and baseline, a participatory plan to involve communities as well as the identification of implementing partners and negotiation pertaining to implementation arrangements and co-financing.The Project Preparation Grant (PPG) was approved by the GEF Secretariat to prepare a Full-Size Project Document (FSP) for submission under the GEF-6 STAR. In this context an International Consultant Team Leader is required to prepare the FSP, focusing on all components proposed in the PIF, and expected outcomes to be achieved, as outlined in the approved Project Identification Form (PIF). The Request for GEF CEO Endorsement and the UNDP Project Document plus ancillary documentation must therefore be nationally validated and finalized for internal UNDP clearance no later than 31 March 2018.

A preliminary assessment recently conducted under the auspices of the High-level Panel on Global Assessment of Resources for Implementing the CBD Strategic Plan estimated that the global investment required ranges between 130 and 440 billion US$ annually. While useful, this and similar other global estimates are based on extrapolations sensitive to the underlying assumptions. To define biodiversity finance needs and gaps with greater precision and determine related challenges and opportunities for resource mobilisation, detailed national-level (bottom-up) assessments are therefore required.In this context, UNDP in October 2012 launched the Biodiversity Finance Initiative C BIOFIN, as a new global partnership seeking to address the biodiversity finance challenge in a comprehensive manner C building a sound business case for increased investment in the management of ecosystems and biodiversity, with a particular focus on the needs and transformational opportunities at the national level.BIOFIN works along two main axes:1. Globally-led development of a new methodological frameworkAn entirely new methodological framework is being developed for undertaking national-level “bottom-up” analyses of the finance-relevant enabling context; for determining the current / baseline investment in biodiversity; for quantifying the full cost of meeting national biodiversity conservation targets and the resulting finance gap; and for assessing the suitability of financial mechanisms and developing national resource mobilisation strategies. The methodologies applied in the project will be refined through regional and global learning, and made available more widely.2. Adaptation and implementation of this new methodological framework at national levelTo help countries increase the importance attributed to biodiversity and in consequence bridge the financing gap, the work at national level will be led by Ministries of Finance, Planning or Economics and the Ministry of Environment, and is articulated through the following components:Analyse the integration of biodiversity and ecosystem services in sectoral and development policy, planning and budgetingAssess future financing flows, needs and gaps for managing and conserving biodiversity and ecosystem servicesDevelop comprehensive national Resource Mobilisation Strategies to meet the biodiversity finance gapInitiate implementation of the Resource Mobilisation Strategy at national levelIn Thailand, BIOFIN supports the Royal Thai Government in implementing the National Economics and Social Development Plans, in particular relevant sections on sustainable utilization of natural resources, green growth, and inclusive development, through the formulation and implementation of financial strategies. The expected outputs of Thailand’s BIOFIN project include (i) a baseline status of policies, institutions, expenditures related to biodiversity conservation and sustainable utilisation in Thailand, (ii) a preliminary cost estimate for biodiversity investment covering the next five years, (iii) development of Resource Mobilisation Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation. Apart from strengthening Thailand’s obligation to the CBD, the expectations during the first phase of project’s duration of approximately three years (2014 C 2017) is that there would be increased awareness and evidence-based demonstration on the significance of biodiversity as a foundation to economic growth, security, and well-being as well as increasing south-south exchanges among BIOFIN countries.The Biodiversity Finance Initiative’s Phase I (2014 C 2017) in Thailand takes shape through three assessments that culminate in its Biodiversity Finance Plan. The three assessments include the following components:The Biodiversity Finance Policy and Institutional Review (PIR) looks into the policy and institutional context for biodiversity finance in the country and establishes which the key stakeholders to involve are. The integrated PIR report of Thailand will cover the four thematic ecosystems, namely terrestrial, coastal and marine, wetlands (inland) and urban biodiversity;The Biodiversity Expenditure Review (BER) is an analysis of public, private and civil society organization expenditures in the country that benefit biodiversity. The assessment establishes past, present and projected expenditures on biodiversity;The Biodiversity Financial Needs Assessment (FNA) estimates the finance required with unit cost estimation in both lower bound and higher bound scenarios so as to deliver national biodiversity targets and plans, usually described in the NBSAPs. For Thailand, the estimates of financing needs for biodiversity conservation are based on (i) National Biodiversity Strategic and Action Plans (NBSAP) and (ii) the NBSAP plus with budget estimate of line agencies under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.The Biodiversity Finance Initiative’s Phase II (2018 C 2022) in Thailand will build on the wealth of learning generated over the Biodiversity Finance Plan which covered the above-mentioned three assessments. All BIOFIN countries that completed their Biodiversity Finance Plan will focus on implementation of pilot projects in the country.The Biodiversity Finance Plan (BFP) identify a mix of suitable biodiversity finance solutions to reduce the biodiversity finance gap. The last component of the BIOFIN process is the implementation phase. The BIOFIN national teams make a selection between the prioritized finance solutions and provide technical support for their implementation.They will provide impacts allowing to reach the national targets through four main results:Generate revenues, i.e. any existing or innovative mechanism or instrument that can generate and/or leverage financial resources to allocate to biodiversity. Examples include the attraction of impact investment in conservation projects, the review or introduction of green taxes, etc.;Realign current expenditures, i.e. any measure that can reorient existing financial flows towards biodiversity. This result can be achieved by phasing out and reforming fossil fuel/ energy subsidies and using these freed resources to invest in renewable energy or green infrastructure instead.Avoid future biodiversity expenditures, i.e. any measure that can prevent or reduce future investment needs by eliminating or amending existing counter-productive policies and expenditures. This can be achieved by taxes that can generate a double dividend, or by fines for stopping ecosystem contamination by alien invasive species.Deliver financial resources more effectively and efficiently, i.e. any measure or instrument that can enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency in budget execution, achieve synergies and/or favour a more equitable distribution of resources. Examples include the establishment of biodiversity business challenge funds, the merger of national conservation funds, the establishment of central procurement units or staff incentives to increase delivery of resources.The detailed screening process of Biodiversity Finance solutions for Thailand was conducted which produced a list of finance solutions that are deemed ‘realistic’. The next step is to conduct the detailed screening by members of BIOFIN country team, Steering Committee and other related organization where useful. The solutions will need to be reviewed thoroughly by experts. For Thailand, the scoring was cross-checked by an expert panel and publicly validated in the meeting organized by NESDB. Therefore, the prioritized BFP in Thailand will include Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES), Nutrient Trading system, Biodiversity Offsets and the Impact Investment by Thai private sector under co-financing scheme.",科学研究,"Home-based in Thailand, with possible travel to pilot sites in Thailand,  THAILAND                      ",,01 September 2017 to 31 August 2018 with maximum 250 working days,Aug-22-18,"Requirements for Experience and Qualifications: MS or PhD level with degree in Economics, Finance, Environment, Social sciences and/or other related fields;Work experience in relevant technical areas for at least 10 years in research, biodiversity conservation scheme and analysis of resources/environment and economic linkages;Experience with analysis the BIOFIN components as stated in BIOFIN Workbook;Familiar and up-to-date with national and local programs, projects and initiatives on biodiversity conservation and related areas;Excellent English and Thai writing and speaking.Payment terms for the contract.X Lump SumPrice Proposal and Schedule of Payment :Consultant must send a financial proposal based on Lump Sum Amount.

In close consultation with (i) BIOFIN Thailand Steering Committee, (ii) BIOFIN Project Management Unit of UNDP Thailand and (iii) Global BIOFIN Core Team, the CTA will bring the Biodiversity Finance Plan and/or business cases into attention of key stakeholders― decision makers and prospective investors with rationale for prioritizing biodiversity finance in policy, legislation, plans and projects in a language that the stakeholders of those activities can understand.At the solution level, the CTA will be able to provide additional lists of national experts for further procurement on a short term basis to work with the expert for related activities during the pilot project implementation period. S/he will present the technical proposal with business case(s) for which it will include technical and financial justifications to elaborate the selection and design of the prioritised finance solutions. These business cases for the Biodiversity Finance Plan should be a combination of two approaches C one that examines the economic benefits of sustainable biodiversity management in Thailand Cwhy implement the Finance Plan at all? The other approach is aimed at elaborating an investment case for each finance solution.Scope of WorkThe CTA will play a leading role in technical aspects and coordinating with the key stakeholders and other contributing experts in order to implement the proposed finance plans in Thailand.The scopes of work are as follows:Preparation involves defining the scope of work, identifying key stakeholders and reviewing the BIOFIN assessments C Biodiversity Finance Policy and Institutional Review, Biodiversity Expenditure Review and Financial Needs Assessment;Description of existing and potential finance solutions C includes an initial listing and description of the finance solution already implemented in the country, as well as ‘scanning the horizon’ by using the finance solutions catalogue in the 2016 BIOFIN Workbook to design new finance solutions and strategies;Assessment and prioritization of the finance solutions C conducting a rapid screening process of all identified finance solutions, following by a more detailed screening exercise to derive prioritised solutions. The selection process should be conducted by the CTA based on evidence and participatory engagement of local experts and stakeholders;Formulation of technical proposals for priority solutions C drafting technical documents that describe the core elements of the solutions including the justification and rationale, the expected financial results, sequencing, risks, etc. The technical proposals will be instrumental for making a solid business case for each solution and for the Finance Plan;Formulation of a business case for the Plan and the finance solutions C the purpose is to gather evidence to persuade the government, prospective investors and stakeholders on the opportunity of implementing the Plan and investing in biodiversity.Finalizing the Biodiversity Finance Plans C validation process with stakeholders must be conducted. The related communication materials shall be developed. Scope of work here include drafting of summary reports, recommendations and policy briefs and discussing the Finance Plan with decision makers and prospective investors. The business case should address the expected impacts on biodiversity, finance, socio-economic and gender aspects in consistent with the intent of the National Economic and Social Development Plan, the National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans, related policy documents e.g. the 20-year National Strategic Plan, Thailand 4.0 Policy, and the Sustainable Development Goals. **See Annex I: Sample Template for the design and implementation of finance solutions under BIOFIN’s Component 4.

For example, studies show carbon emissions by national health systems and global health programmes are closely linked to procurements, especially with regards to pharmaceuticals and other health products throughout their life cycle including production, use, and disposal(1, 2, 3) The UN’s journey towards their operational climate neutrality began officially on 5th June 2007 when UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon publicly called on all UN agencies, funds and programmes to ‘go green’ and become climate neutral. Driven initially by the UN initiative “Greening the Blue” (4), with interest to promote climate neutrality within the UN, the focus was largely on addressing associated greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Sustainable UN facility in collaboration with sustainability focal points in about 60 UN entities and the HLCM procurement network has extended the focus area onto other critically important purchasing categories as well including the focus on resource depletion and eco- and human-toxicity in the procurement in the context of procurements for the health sector.The informal Interagency Task Team on Sustainable Procurement in the Health Sector (5) (SPHS) was established in May 2012 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Ten SPHS members (UNDP, UNEP, UNFPA, UHNCR, UNICEF, UNOPS, WHO, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID) conduct high volume procurement in the health sector, representing a sizable portion of some segments of the global pharmaceutical and other health products markets. The cumulative purchasing power of SPHS members in the global health aid market is about USD 5 billion annually. The aim of establishing the Task Team was to facilitate and coordinate the introduction of sustainable procurement in the health sector among members and to leverage the standard-setting and joint procurement volumes of member agencies to influence the global health sector (governments and other international development partners) and beyond. Thereby the SPHS Task Team intends to act as driver for transformational change towards greener health systems and inclusive green economies.(6, 7)Besides the coordination of activities conducted by each member of the SPHS, its members follow a joint roadmap and strategy addressing normative aspects of sustainable procurement, the step-wise introduction of sustainable procurement criteria, the engagement with other purchasers in the global health sector and beyond as catalyst for sustainable procurement in the health sector at large, and the engagement process with suppliers and manufacturers of health commodities. This strategy is summarized in a recently published engagement strategy with the global supplier and manufacturer network of the SPHS, which is based on the vision and route map of the SPHS (8) and makes reference to the UN Supplier Code of Conduct. (9) The overall aim of the strategy is to represent SPHS members’ commitment to work in collaboration with suppliers and manufacturers to introduce green procurement in the global health sector. Through a transparent and inclusive engagement process, and by leveraging their normative and market power, members commit to lowering the environmental impact of their procurement, with a final aim of improving human health and well-being. Since inception, the SPHS has been supported and coordinated by a Secretariat administered by UNDP. Internships offer a small group of outstanding graduate-level students the opportunity to acquire direct exposure to UNDP's work. They are designed to complement development-oriented studies with practical experience in various aspects of multilateral technical cooperation but also complement other international studies, including environmental sciences. While the primary objective of this internship is to assist the SPHS Secretariat in administrative and logistical services, the intern will also have the chance to conduct vital in-depth research, support the organization of a global conference and regional working sessions, support the communications activities, as well as support the development of project proposals with a focus on the SPHS mandate.References: (1) http://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/rbec/en/home/library/hiv_aids/rapid-assessment-healthcare-waste-global-fund(2) http://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/rbec/en/home/library/hiv_aids/Carbon_footprint_UNDP_Global_Fund_health_initiatives_Montenegro_Tajikistan/(3) http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hiv-aids/managing-our-climate-change-risk--an-approach-for-environmental-.html(4) http://www.greeningtheblue.org/(5) www.savinglivesustainably.org(6) https://issuu.com/informal_int_task_team_sphs/docs/sphs-6-pager(7) https://issuu.com/informal_int_task_team_sphs/docs/sphs_annual_report_2016(8) https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7mQ_2UCdoL4cDFkcVJBMHRqX28/view(9) https://www.un.org/Depts/ptd/sites/www.un.org.Depts.ptd/files/files/attachment/page/2014/February%202014/conduct_english.pdf",科学研究,"Istanbul,  TURKEY                        ",,6 months starting in October 2017 (full time),Sep-14-17,"Education:Applicants to the UNDP internship programme must at the time of application meet one of the following requirements: a) be enrolled in a graduate school programme (second university degree or equivalent, or higher); b) be enrolled in the final academic year of a first university degree programme (minimum Bachelor’s level or equivalent); or c) have graduated with a university degree (as defined in (a) and (b) above) in a relevant discipline (environmental studies, public health or health and environment, economics, public or business administration) and, if selected, must start the internship within one-year of graduationExperience:Knowledge of sustainable development terminology a strong advantage;Should be available 40 hours a week for six months;Experience in project writing; resource mobilization; partnership building; experience in event management; communications would be an asset;Proficient with managing Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and data bases;Solid writing and communications abilities;Languages:Written and spoken proficiency in at least one, and preferably two of the three working languages used by UNDP: English, French and Spanish;Fluency in Arabic, Portuguese, Russian or Eastern European language is an asset.

The RPD is structured around four outcomes selected from the UNDP Strategic Plan (2014-2017) that are considered most relevant to regional needs and the comparative advantage of UNDP in Asia and the Pacific at the regional level.The four Outcomes of the RPD are:Growth and development are inclusive and sustainable, incorporating productive capacities that create employment and livelihoods for the poor and excluded.Citizens’ expectations for voice, effective development, the rule of law and accountability are met by stronger systems of democratic governance.Countries are able to reduce the likelihood of conflict, and lower the risks of natural disasters, including from climate change.Development debates and actions at all levels prioritize poverty, inequality and exclusion, consistent with UNDP engagement principles.The Regional Programme is intended to capture the multi-faceted nature of the work that is carried out at the regional level, which combines inter-country cooperation initiatives in consultation with and approval of the countries involved, and the provision of policy advisory services in support of the implementation of country programmes in the region and the achievement of development effectiveness at the country level. The work of UNDP at the regional level is guided and informed by the five regionality principles (see below) and a number of key cross-cutting issues including gender equality in terms of how UNDP work at the regional level.The five regionality principles are:Promotion of regional public goods, based on strengthened regional cooperation and integration;Management of cross-border externalities and spillovers that are best addressed collaboratively on an inter-country basis;Advancement of awareness, dialogue and action on sensitive and/or emerging development issues that benefit strongly from multi-country experiences and perspectives;Promotion of experimentation and innovation to overcome institutional, financial and/or informational barriers that may be too high for an individual country to surmount;Generation and sharing of development knowledge, experience and expertise, for instance, through South-South and triangular cooperation, so that countries can connect to, and benefit from, relevant experiences from across the region and beyond.In keeping with UNDP’s results-based approach and to establish clear and measurable indicators of achievement at both output and outcome levels of the RPD, two umbrella Regional Project Documents “Advancing Inclusive and Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific (2014-2017)” and “Achieving the simultaneous eradication of poverty and a significant reduction of inequalities and exclusion in the Pacific (2014-2017)” were development by the UNDP Regional Policy and Programme Support (RPPS), Bangkok Regional Hub (BRH), and the Pacific Centre in Fiji, respectively.

This will also include a review of the effectiveness of regional knowledge products with specific relevance to supporting GEWE in Asia and the Pacific.The methodology for data collection will be largely from internal UNDP sources: project progress monitoring reports, project evaluation reports, interviews (face-to-face or remotely) with the management teams and advisors at BRH and the Pacific Office in Fiji, as well as selected Country Offices, and UN partners.

The creation of UN Women came about as part of the UN reform agenda, bringing together resources and mandates for greater impact. It merges and builds on the important work of four previously distinct parts of the UN system (DAW, OSAGI, INSTRAW and UNIFEM), which focused exclusively on gender equality and women's empowerment.The UN Women Regional Office for Arab States (ROAS) located in Cairo, supports programmes broadening the scope of women’s citizenship, leadership and political participation, especially in countries affected by crisis and undergoing transition. This is essential to meeting women and girls needs in crisis, and ensuring that transitions are both fully inclusive and democratic, and respond to the needs and priorities of women and girls. Additionally, and as part of broader momentum for reform across the Arab States, and towards institutionalizing gender in governance, ROAS assists efforts to make national plans and budgets fully supportive of gender equality commitments. Economic empowerment is another critical concern, therefore, ROAS engages with regional partners and civil society to advance policies and programmes that bolster women’s opportunities in this arena. Ending violence against women is another critical component of UN Women ROAS by supporting the adoption of national policy frameworks, reforming laws discriminating against women, establishing comprehensive prevention and protection services, and raising awareness of strategies to combat violence.The Regional Office is leading and supporting the roll out of a number of programmes on peace, security and humanitarian action. These programmes aim both to meet the needs of women and girls in crisis settings, and to ensure that they are active participants in shaping humanitarian aid flows and peace and security processes C for the promotion of equality and empowerment.

Les populations de ces 3 régions du Nord sous occupation ont subi de plein fouet depuis fin mars 2012, les conséquences sociopolitiques et économiques de la crise. Certains se sont exilés vers les pays limitrophes et d’autres ont été des déplacés internes loin de leurs milieux de vie. Les populations déplacées sont actuellement estimées à plus de 198 690 (près de 61 921 000 PDI et 136 772 réfugiés), 423 427 personnes sont retournées dans leurs zones d’origine. Ces catégories énumérées sont principalement les plus affectées par la crise. Néanmoins, il faut souligner que les populations restées sur place, y compris les communautés h?tes, ont également vu leur vulnérabilité aggravée par la crise. Elles ont perdu leur capital de production et dépendent souvent de l’assistance humanitaire. A ces défis liés au déplacement s’ajoutent d’autres urgences humanitaires telles : la malnutrition. Selon les résultats du cadre harmonisé de novembre 2016, 3 550 000 personnes sont en situation d’insécurité alimentaire. Les catastrophes humanitaires constituent un autre facteur de crise humanitaire et on estime que 65 000 personnes sont sous menaces d’inondations. L’accès aux services de base telles les écoles et les structures de santé reste un défi important dans les régions du nord surtout suite à la fermeture de la plus part des services administratifs. Le mouvement de personnes concerne essentiellement les femmes et les enfants et certaines ont fait objet de violations flagrantes sous la forme de violences physiques, viols individuels et collectifs. Face à ce tableau sombre mettant en danger la survie de plusieurs vies humaines, la réponse humanitaire s’est organisée rapidement pour venir au secours de ces populations affectées par la guerre et alléger leurs souffrances. Sous la coordination de OCHA, cette réponse est articulée autour des secteurs suivants : (1) abri/ biens non alimentaires, (2) eau, hygiène et assainissement, (3) éducation, (4) nutrition, (5) protection, (6) relèvement précoce, (7)santé, (8) sécurité alimentaire.Dans cette situation d’urgence humanitaire, les hommes et les femmes ont souffert différemment des affres de la guerre et du corollaire de ses impacts. En effet les femmes et les enfants constituent la grande majorité des personnes déplacées, soufrant le plus de l’absence des services de base et sont les plus exposées aux violences et différents abus.

UN Women globally focuses on key priority areas that are fundamental to women’s equality, and that can unlock progress across the board. UN Women’s priority areas include increasing women’s leadership and participation in political spaces, ending violence against women, enhancing women’s economic empowerment, engaging in all aspects of women peace and security processes, making gender equality central to national planning and budgeting through Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB) and advancing gender in intergovernmental processes.UN Women’s work on GRB involves ensuring that national planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation processes incorporate a gender perspective. UN Women’s GRB programmes at the regional and country level have made significant contribution towards this by building political support, developing technical resources and capacities, generating good practices for improving women's access to services and increasing accountability for Gender Equality and Women’s empowerment (GEWE). At the forefront of global, regional and local advocacy for application of GRB, UN Women has built partnerships with diverse government, inter-governmental and non-governmental partners to further efforts and demonstrate GRB’s relevance to sustainable development, aid effectiveness, public sector reform and financing for development.In 2004-05, the report of the expert group of classification of government expenditure became instrumental in laying out the road map for GRB in India. This was followed by the adoption of “Budgeting for Gender Equity” as mission statement by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD), Government of India (GoI). In 2005-06, the Ministry of Finance, GoI introduced Gender Budget Statement (GBS) which aimed to reflect the quantum of budgetary allocations for programmes/schemes that substantially benefit women. Another important mechanism institutionalised by the Ministry of Finance was setting up of Gender Budget Cells (GBCs) which serve as focal points for mainstreaming gender through GRB. The rigour has been replicated in at least 19 states, some of which have produced GBS and set up GBCs.UN Women’s Multi Country Office (MCO), based in New Delhi, India, covers four countries of the region, i.e., India, Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. UN Women India MCO is currently implementing a project with the objective of identifying strategies and operational approaches to strengthen on-going efforts on GRB in India, at the national and state level.Insights generated from this project will enable key stakeholders at the national and state level to accelerate their efforts to ensure that women’s priorities are adequately reflected in national budgeting processes, and to make concrete changes for adequate resource allocation towards women’s priorities. The focus areas of the project are the following:Establishing/strengthening institutional mechanisms for GRB.Generating evidence on how sectoral policies/programmes could be made more gender responsive.Enhancing capacities of officials for sustaining change.Strengthening the link between outlays to outcomes through gender audit.Within this context, UN Women seeks the services of a Technical Expert to undertake GRB analysis of policies and programmes from the perspective of women with disabilities and tribal women. The research will aim to generate/strengthen evidence on the existing gaps in policy/programme design, budgeting, implementation and evaluation from a gender perspective. Analysis for women and girls with disabilities will be undertaken at the union level, working with the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Ministry of Social Empowerment, Government of India; whereas, that for tribal women and girls will be undertaken with Governments of Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh.

Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to engage in GRB globally. Recognising the need to develop specific methodologies and analytical tools to integrate gender into the national budget, pilot studies were initiated by the Commonwealth Secretariat in five countries. The study brought to fore critical insights into the public expenditure incidence on women vis-à-vis men across the select sectors. Most recently, recognising the urgent need for accelerating investments for rural women, on the initiative and push by the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA), a Cabinet Memorandum was issued on 9th March 2016 mandating allocation of at least 25 percent of all investment on rural economic development for women. UN Women is working closely with MoWCA to ensure that the Cabinet Memorandum is actualised. The next logical step would to expand the GRB interventions to select sectors.In this regard, UN Women India MCO is currently implementing a one year project with support from the Republic of Korea with the objective of supporting the Sri Lankan Government’s ongoing efforts in addressing the specific issues confronted by women with disabilities in economic life.

It provides strong and coherent leadership in support of Member States’ priorities and efforts, building effective partnerships with civil society and other relevant actors. The UN Women Multi-Country Office (UNW MCO) works in India, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka.Unit/ Project Background:Investing in women’s economic empowerment sets a direct path towards gender equality, poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth. Women make enormous contributions to economies, whether in businesses, on farms, as entrepreneurs or employees, or by doing unpaid care work at home. But they also remain disproportionately affected by poverty, discrimination and exploitation. Gender discrimination means that women often end up in insecure, low-wage jobs, and constitute a small minority of those in senior positions. It curtails access to economic assets such as land and loans. It limits participation in shaping economic and social policies. And, because women perform the bulk of household work, they often have little time left to pursue economic opportunities.In this context, the Women’s Economic Empowerment Unit is, at present, focusing on engendering macro-economic analysis and national economies in the region, assisting to develop policy and praxis accountability and monitoring mechanisms for women’s economic empowerment, access and rights to land and productive assets, gender parity in wages and safe migration.UN Women past work in the region has correspondingly focused on centre-staging women’s resource rights and capabilities, their voice and agency and ending all forms of gender based violence in policy formulation and programme implementation on sustainable livelihoods. UN Women supports the leadership and participation of rural women in finding solutions to the problems and issues that affect their lives, especially improved food and nutrition security and enhanced rural livelihoods. UN Women also engages with various government bodies to develop and implement laws and policies that promote equal rights, opportunities and participation, so that rural women can benefit from India’s growth story, obtain financing, upgrade their skills, market their goods, and make a strong contribution to inclusive economic growth in an environment free of discrimination and violence.The purpose of this internship is to provide support to the knowledge building and management activities of programmes within the WEE unit.

UN Women implemented a three-year programme entitled ‘Promoting Women’s Political Leadership and Governance in India (from 2011 to 2014), aimed at empowering elected women representatives in local governance to make public policy and resource allocation patterns responsive to women’s human rights. Phase I of the Governance Programme was a demand-driven programme implemented, in partnership with the Ministry of Panchayati Raj and select state governments, to build capacities of elected women panchayat leaders across 5 states in collaboration with state governments, trainings institutions and civil society organizations. Through the projects, efforts were also made to strengthen women’s collectives and creating linkages with local institutions. The larger objective was to open up and activate spaces and initiatives for public participation, by mobilizing and supporting women to engage with public institutions such as the Gram Sabha. Significant results were achieved with regard to increasing political participation of women through the activation of Gram Sabha, organization of Mahila Sabhas with the help of motivators, and training of EWRs and other functionaries.UN Women is currently implementing the second phase of the programme, entitled, From Opportunities to Capacities: A Multi-Sectoral Approach to Enhancing Gender Responsive Governance (from 2015 to 2018). The second phase of the programme aims to build a body of evidence, to inform and enhance the capacity of governance institutions to better respond to the real opportunities for gender equality and women’s empowerment that have been created through progressive legislation, policies and programmes. These enhanced governance capacities should lead to better outcomes for women.The programme is being implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Panchayati Raj across six states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Odisha.In this context the proposed programme will work towards strengthening capacities of national and sub national governments for gender responsive design and implementation of key schemes and policies, so as to ensure better outcomes for women especially those from the most marginalized communities. This will be operationalized through strengthening training institutions (at the national and sub-national level such as NIRD&PR and SIRDs); and developing effective mechanisms to build capacities of elected representatives and functionaries of the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).UN Women partnered with NIRD&PR during the first phase of its programme on GRG. The overarching goal of the program was to create an enabling environment to empower Elected Women Representatives of Panchayati Raj Institutions to become change agents in political decision making for promotion of gender equality.In the second phase of the programme the NIRD & PR and UN Women partnership will consolidate these efforts towards institutional strengthening in PRIs.In connection with the above tasks, UN Women will place a Programme Analyst at the Centre for Gender Studies & Development (CGAD), NIRD & PR.

That created a robust framework for implementing the WPS agenda and reinforced global commitments, treaties and conventions on women’s rights, including the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.To deliver these commitments at the national level, the United Nations has encouraged Member States to adopt National Action Plans on WPS (NAPs-WPS) to implement the resolutions and monitor the progress of the WPS agenda. As of August 2017, 66 countries have adopted NAPs-WPS.In Bangladesh, the Government has committed to advancing the development of a NAP-WPS and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) is leading its formulation and drafting.

This type of violence is still tolerated and considered socially acceptable behaviour, and is justified by traditional and patriarchal conceptions of the role and status of women in BiH society.The entry into force of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) in August 2014 has marked an important milestone in the BiH efforts to curb violence against women and girls, in addition to new legislation on protection from family violence that was adopted in 2012 in both of BiH’s entities. However, there is still a need to harmonize these laws at all levels and implement their necessary provisions to ensure legal protection, equal treatment and respecting the rights of women and children, who are recognized as the most frequent victims of gender-based violence. “Standards and Engagement for Ending Violence against Women and Domestic Violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina”, is a three-year programme (2016-2019) developed by the UN Women Country Office in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and financially supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). The programme aims to strengthen the institutional and social response mechanisms to violence against women (VAW) and domestic violence (DV) in BiH by contributing to the implementation of the Istanbul Convention. Furthermore, the proposed activities of the programme build upon the initiatives identified in the entity strategies on combating violence against women and domestic violence. The programme presents a comprehensive, transformative approach towards gender equality and women’s empowerment.The programme builds on the previous work of UN Women and other UN agencies in BiH at the policy level as well as the support provided to improve services for survivors and to prevent violence against women and girls since 2008. The activities are being implemented in several locations: municipalities of Central Bosnia Canton and Canton 10, Bijeljina, Bratunac, Brcko District, East Sarajevo, Foca, Lopare, Milici, Rogatica, Srebrenica, Visegrad, Vlasenica and Zvornik. The programme has two main components that are focusing on protection of survivors and prevention of gender-based violence (GBV).Component 1. Improvement of the availability, accessibility and quality of services to survivors of violence against women and domestic violence.Under this component, UN Women is working on improvement of availability, access and quality of services utilizing a multi-sectorial approach to address violence against women and domestic violence in BiH through the partnerships with institutions and NGOs.FBiH Gender Center and RS Gender Center work on enhancement of accessibility of services for survivors of gender-based violence at cantonal and local level trough coordination bodies and referral mechanisms.Foundation Lara Bijeljina is implementing the project with the aim of building capacities of local institutions working on violence against women and DV, harmonization of standards from Istanbul Convention on local level, and empowerment of women and girls survivors of violence through self-help groups.In Brcko District the non-governmental organization United Women Banja Luka works on strengthening the multi-sectoral approach in protection and prevention of violence against women and DV in all relevant institutions.Work with perpetrators is focused on recognition and establishment of the most efficient model, and institutionalization of the method for better implementation of protective measures prescribed by entity laws. In this area two non-governmental organizations implement their projects -Buducnost Modrica (Milici, Bratunac, Srebrenica, Sokolac, Rogatica, Visegrad) and Zena BiH (Canton 10).Component 2. Promotion of favourable social attitudes and behaviours towards ending violence against women and domestic violence among men, women and young people.Under this component, UN Women together with implementing partners is working on prevention of violence by engaging youth and media:? The Association XY and the organization Medica Zenica work on engagement of men, women and young people in promoting gender equality, eliminating gender stereotypes, facilitating community-based discussion, and supporting action groups to end violence against women. Special focus is on high school students and teachers.? Using media analysis and training of media representatives and public relations professionals the focus is on encouraging responsible reporting on gender-based violence and raising awareness of the criminal nature and extent of GBV and promoting the responsiveness and use of services.",科学研究,"Home-based with travel within the country,  BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA        ",Up to 26 working days,02 October 2017 - 05 December 2017,Sep-24-17,"Academic Qualifications:Bachelor degree in gender studies, political sciences, social sciences, economics, international relations, human rights or related field;Master degree will be considered an asset.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) released in February 2017 found nearly 5 million people in South Sudan severely food insecure; an increase of around 3 million as compared with the previous year. This included 100,000 people facing famine conditions in Unity State. While a scale up of humanitarian assistance in Unity State has pulled back these 100,000 people from famine, the food security situation remains dire, according to the IPC update published in June 2017. Over 5.5 million people faced severe food insecurity in May and an estimated 6 million people are likely to be severely food insecurity between June and July. The number of people facing emergency levels of hunger - one step below famine - is 1.7 million - up from 1 million in February, indicating an overall worsening situation with the peak of the lean season still ahead. Increasingly, households in other parts of the country who used to be food secure are finding it difficult to meet their basic food needs.WFP Resilience ProgrammesFFAAlthough insecurity prevails in many parts of South Sudan, there are clear pockets of stability where resilience building and livelihoods activities are essential to strengthen local communities and farmers’ capacities. In these areas, WFP is implementing food assistance for assets (FFA) activities to meet immediate food needs while helping households develop resilience against future shocks and stresses. The combination of conditional food assistance and asset creation helps food insecure communities to shift away from reliance on humanitarian assistance to achieve more sustainable food security. In 2017, WFP aims to assist around 473,000 people through FFA, including 240,000 women and girls, in Abyei, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Lakes and Western Equatoria States. Households are engaged in asset creation activities including community access road rehabilitation, school and clinic construction, and vegetable gardening, and crop production.P4PThrough Purchase for Progress (P4P), WFP aims to increase production, improve post-harvest handing and strengthen collective marketing thus linking male and female smallholder farmers to viable markets (including to WFP) for their crop surpluses. P4P’s efforts in South Sudan compliment the Government's commitment to investments in agriculture. In 2017, WFP is working with more than 10,000 small holder farmers C nearly half of which are women - in the Equatorias region. WFP plans to procure over 1,000 metric tonnes (mt) of locally produced maize and sorghum from small holder farmer groups this year.FFEWFP’s Food for Education (FFE) programme is implemented across South Sudan to reduce short term hunger among primary school children. FFE creates a positive incentive and contributes towards higher school enrolment, better retention and completion of schooling while promoting gender equality. This year, the programme targets 300,000 children in highly food insecure communities, with low enrolments as well as poor educational outcomes.Combined, FFA, P4P and FFE programmes form WFP’s resilience strategy for South Sudan. This broad range of support, including asset creation, safety nets, and sustainable livelihoods programmes, help to assist communities with recovery and increase their resilience to future shocks. At the same time, WFP’s resilience activities help food insecure households meet their immediate food needs.",科学研究,"Juba,  SOUTH SUDAN",8 weeks,,Sep-15-17,"Educational Qualifications:A master’s degree in a relevant social sciences field such as sociology, gender studies, economics or other related field.

Les Programmes Phares ont été développés autour des axes d’intervention de ONU Femmes qui sont :la participation politiques des femmes:l’autonomisation économique de la femme;la lutte contre les VBG (violences basées sur le genre);la participation au processus de paix, et;la planification et budgétisation sensible au genre.Les Programmes Phares, sont des programmes à grand impact, structurés autour de la prise en compte des droits humains. Cela laisse voir le niveau de structuration équilibrée dans la conception dudit programme afin qu’il puisse apporter valablement la croissance ou le changement attendu dans la vie des femmes, dans un domaine donné.ONU Femmes a initié les Programmes Phares pour les principales raisons suivantes :Avoir une approche qui permettra de mieux atteindre les ODD ;Promouvoir une approche d’intervention basée sur les droits humains, pour la réduction de la pauvreté et des inégalités ;Mettre l’accès sur la capacitation, l’expertise et le leadership de la société civile ;Avoir un cadre d’action harmonisé d’un pays à l’autre, basé sur des théories de changement pré établisPromouvoir des approches basées sur les évidences.En Haiti, ONU Femmes contribue à relever les défis liés à la promotion de l’égalité du genre et l’autonomisation des femmes à travers des actions guidées par les orientations stratégiques du PND 2016-2020, et qui s’inscrivent dans l’esprit ? Unie dans l’Action ? du Système des Nations Unies à travers son Cadre de Programmation Unique, CPU 2017-2020.Au regard des difficultés auxquelles les femmes haitiennes sont confrontées, ONU Femmes Haiti a choisi de développer les quatre Programmes Phares suivants :Agriculture : Accès des femmes à la terre et aux ressources productives pour une agriculture résiliente face aux changements climatiques;Entreprenariat : Favoriser les mêmes opportunités économiques pour les femmes entrepreneures à travers des politiques d'approvisionnement et d'investissement discriminatoires en leur faveur;Elimination de la Violence : Elimination de la violence faite aux femmes ;Paix et Sécurité : Implication des femmes dans les processus de paix, de sécurité et de reconstruction.Pour ce faire, ONU Femmes en Haiti cherche à constituer un Roster/Liste des Expert(e)s Agréé(e)s susceptibles de soutenir les activités du programme au sein du bureau de Port-au-Prince et/ou sur le terrain.",科学研究,"Port-au-Prince,  HAITI                         ",,,Oct-2-17,"Formation (Education) :Etre titulaire au moins d’un dipl?me universitaire de niveau Master en études de genre, sciences sociales, sociologie, relations internationales, études de développement, sciences politiques ou autre qualifications pouvant répondre aux exigences du poste.Expérience (Experience) :Au moins 5 ans d'expérience dans le travail de développement avec un accent particulier sur la paix et la sécurité en matière d'égalité des sexes et / ou d'autonomisation des femmes ;Expérience dans le développement, la mise en ?uvre, le suivi ou l'évaluation de projets de développement ;Expérience dans ce domaine ou dans un domaine similaire en Haiti serait considérée comme un atout ;Expérience professionnelle antérieure avec les Nations Unies ou des organisations similaires dans ce domaine ou dans un domaine similaire serait considérée comme un atout ;Expérience de l'élaboration d'analyses et de rapports sur les questions liées au genre serait considérée comme un atout ;Expérience de la formation est un atout.Compétences Linguistiques (Language) :Une excellente ma?trise de la langue fran?aise et d’excellentes capacités rédactionnelles dans cette langue sont exigées.

The UN Women TC offers training for gender equality and women’s empowerment to staff from UN Women and other UN agencies, as well as to government, civil society and partners. The gender capacity-development programmes range from basic and introductory levels to specialized and advanced levels, aimed at diverse audiences with different backgrounds. In terms of capacity-development strategies and techniques, the TC makes maximum use of on-line training techniques, paying special attention to e-learning courses and an active learning approach.In 2012, the UN Women Training Centre conducted a survey among UN Women regional offices in order to assess the needs of UN Women, UN staff and external partners. A main finding from the survey was that gender-responsive planning and budgeting (GRB) was a topic of great interest for UN Women, the UN System and external partners.Gender-responsive planning and budgeting is also included as part of Impact Area 5 of the UN Women Strategic Plan (2014-2017): “governance and national planning fully reflect accountability for gender equality commitments and priorities”. The team supporting this area of work is located in the Leadership and Governance Section of the Policy Division.Within the Leadership and Governance Section, the Governance and National Planning team (GNP) supports the organization’s efforts to ensure gender-responsive governance frameworks that focus on public sector functions related to priority setting in service delivery and investment (planning and budgeting). UN Women’s work on Governance and National Planning builds on its GRB programming and expands its scope to engage with mainstream planning processes, to upscale the approaches and lessons learnt and to institutionalize them within public administration at large.In collaboration with the Leadership and Governance Section, the Training Centre has included in its 2014 and 2015 work plans the development of a training package. Considering that some experiences and training products already exist in different regions, as a first step the UWTC undertook a mapping and desk review which identified existing GRB courses and their main characteristics, identified courses specifically developed by UN Women and determined which of the available courses could be included as part of this training package. It was decided to develop three progressive courses: a basic self-paced course, an intermediary online moderated course and an advanced face-to-face course. The intermediary and advanced courses were piloted in 2016-2017, in a collaboration between the Training Centre and the Leadership and Governance Section. The contents of the moderated course were translated into Spanish and French and three courses were delivered in 2017, one in each language. The Training Centre plans to deliver the advanced face-to-face course in Spanish in September 2017, in Santo Domingo.",科学研究,"home based,  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC            ",3 Months,3 Months,Oct-13-17,"Education: Master degree, preferably in Development Economics, Public Policy, or similar areas and Gender studies.Work ExperienceMinimum of 5 years of relevant experience in gender mainstreaming and/or gender-responsive planning and budgetingMinimum of 5 years of relevant experience in the field of training for adults, capacity building, and transformative educationWork experience in knowledge management and capacity development projectsExperience in facilitating participatory, interactive, multi-cultural training for adultsWork experience in coordinating participatory processesExperience working with civil society, NGOs and other development and cooperation organizations at national levelFamiliarity with the UN system will be an asset.

We are on the ground in some 170 countries, working with them on their own solutions to global and national development challenges, and coordinating the efforts of the United Nations at country level. Aiming to eradicate poverty, violence and hunger, UNDP supports countries in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (ECIS) region to translate economic growth into long-lasting, inclusive human development, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The organization works with governments, regional organizations, businesses and communities, helping countries to develop capacity, share knowledge and mobilize funds for sustainable development. As an extension of the UNDP Headquarters, the UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub (IRH), based in Istanbul, Turkey, serves UNDP’s Country Offices in the region, develops high quality knowledge and policy, and is the organization’s main interface with regional bodies such as the European Union. The Centre also implements UNDP’s Regional Programme for ECIS focused on enhancing inclusive and sustainable growth, widening political participation and giving everyone a voice, and developing responsive institutions which deliver desired services and promote inclusive processes of state-society dialogue. At UNDP, external and internal communication―nationally, regionally and globally―is critical to achieving both development results and business objectives. Skillful communication contributes to transparency and development effectiveness, attracts and fosters strong partnerships, and can boost resource mobilization. Communications also plays a crucial role in positioning UNDP as a credible and trusted development partner and thought leader, creating greater awareness about the organization’s work and its impact on the continent.In order to ensure continued support to our initiatives in the ECIS region, UNDP’s IRH invites candidates to send their applications for inclusion in a Vetted Roster of external experts.

Drawing on some of UNDP’s most innovative rule of law programmes in these instances, it has sought to expand such experiences to assist UNDP Country Offices to develop multi-year, comprehensive rule of law programmes that respond rapidly and effectively to the needs on the ground.

Currently, the National Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Master Plan guides the process and it also provides the framework for monitoring development policies and programs in the country. The Master Plan has five components, namely: Monitoring of National Development Strategy (NDS) implementation; Monitoring of Development Outcomes; Impact assessment and policy analysis; Development Monitoring Information System (DMIS); and Communication and Advocacy. The national development strategy, the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy MGDS II, expired in June, 2017 and will be replaced by the MGDS III whose preparation is at an advanced stage. The MGDS III will domesticate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Africa 2063 and other internationally agreed development goals in Malawi.The key responsibility for monitoring overall progress of national strategies is within the remit of the M&E Division in the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development (MoFEPD). However, the role of MoFEPD in guiding monitoring and evaluation of the national strategy is expected to change as the government is in the process of establishing a National Planning Commission whose functions will include monitoring and evaluation of national policies, strategies and programmes.At the sectoral level, joint sector reviews are held as an annual forum for joint assessment of progress. Sector submissions were the basis for the broader annual review of the MGDS. In 2008 Government created 16 Sector Working Group to among other activities provide a platform for inclusive monitoring of sectoral policies, strategies and programmes.The National Statistical Office (NSO) is the agency tasked with providing high quality, timely and independent statistical information.

Support and appreciation for M&E activities differ between sectors and districts, and capacities for conducting M&E are varied in different districts and sectors. Evaluation is an essential component of the M&E cycle, but the level of investment in the evaluation function so far has been very minimal.With support from the Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Development Effectiveness and Accountability Programme (DEAP), the Government undertook a comprehensive assessment of State of M&E in Malawi in 2014. The report decried a poor monitoring and evaluation culture in the country and concluded that deliberate efforts were needed to promote monitoring and evaluation as key ingredients of effective development management. The report recommended placing M&E at the centre of MGDS implementation and in achieving the internationally agreed goals. The report also made a number of recommendations aimed at entrenching monitoring and evaluation functions in development programming in Malawi which included the establishment of an overall M&E Policy and evaluation capacities, while noting that the National M&E Master Plan becomes the vehicle for operationalizing the Policy.It is against this background that MoFEPD with support from DEAP wishes to engage a consultant to support Government to develop the Public Sector M&E Policy.Management and implementation arrangements:The consultant will report to the Director M&E in DoEPD and the UNDP Deputy Resident Representative responsible for programmes.There will be a Reference Group which will provide technical inputs and insights to the whole process.

Another key objective was to promote harmonization and development of intellectual property laws appropriate to the needs of its members and the region. The Harare Protocol on Patents and Industrial Designs, which entered into force in 1984, is the governing instrument on the administration and management of patents for ARIPO. At present, 18 Sub-Saharan African countries are party to the Harare Protocol. Of these six are developing countries while the rest are least developed countries (LDCs). Of the LDCs, 4 are not members of the WTO. Given ARIPO’s status as a regional patent office, successful use of the TRIPS flexibilities hinges considerably on the practices of ARIPO. A critical question is whether ARIPO’s patent filing and grant practices are coherent with, and enable the achievement of, the objectives of the above-mentioned instruments, and public health and development considerations. Recent research suggests “current operations of the ARIPO does not facilitate full use of TRIPS flexibilities and instead erects patent barriers to the importation and local production of affordable medicines.”A three-day regional Conference is proposed in November 2017 in Lilongwe, Malawi, to discuss recent global developments affecting intellectual property law and policy, and undertake an assessment of the Harare Protocol’s relevance and effectiveness in addressing the needs of member states, with reference to the need for integrating public health perspectives and the special needs of LDCs. The meeting has been proposed to be convened in Malawi for a few reasons:There has been political commitment from His Excellency President Mutharika in the past on issues of intellectual property and public health including his role in championing the extension of the WTO Waiver for LDCs at the 2015 General Assembly;The President’s Chief Economic Advisor Dr. Collins Magalasi participated in the Johannesburg Dialogue of the High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines in March 2016 and specifically raised ARIPO as a matter of concern for Malawi;Malawi is currently reforming its intellectual property legislation; andThere is interest and capacity within the UN in Malawi to promote a treatment access agenda.The Conference will therefore be hosted by the Malawi Government under the leadership of President Arthur Peter Mutharika.Specifically, there are three priority areas that warrant discussion and deliberation; namely (1) the implementation and strategic use of the LDCs’ transition periods; (2) the effective integration of public health perspectives and concerns into the ARIPO legal instruments, as well as administration and practices; and (3) the need for increased information and transparency in the patent administration and management system to optimize the benefits of the system.",科学研究,"Lilongwe,  MALAWI                        ",40 working days,40 working days,Sep-14-17,"Education:A minimum of a Master’s Degreee.Experience:Above 7 years professional experience in management of major events.Language:English.Contract Duration:The assignment will run from September, 2017 to December 2017, on a part time basis with a Maximum of 15 days per month.Management:The Consultant will be accountable to UNDP Deputy Resident Representative (Programmes).

The Cambodian government committed itself to ensure access to electricity for 100% of villages by 2020 and 70% of rural households by 2030. The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has also committed to reduce end-user costs. Concomitant to this commitment is the decision that until 2030, some 30% of all households remain without access to the grid (Mekong Strategic Partners, 2016). Under this commitment, the Government aims to expand access by extending the national grid, while reducing costs through a system of price ceilings and subsidies to electricity distributors. The policy pursues a centralized approach towards expanding electricity access, i.e. ‘electrification is led by the government through organizations such as state utilities, electrification agencies or energy ministries, with the extension of the national grid as the main route for increasing access’ (Accenture Development Partnerships, 2015). On the electricity generation site, the government is committed to a large scale hydropower and fossil fuel-based power development programme. In 2014, power generation in Cambodia were distributed as follows: 62% hydro power; 19% liquid fuels (diesel and heavy fuel oil); 18% coal-fired; and just 1% biomass (WWF, 2016).Ensuring access to sustainable access to electricity requires a thorough long term plan as well as takes into account many development challenges such as population growth, migration to urban areas and rapid economic developments with a large increase in demand for electricity. External factors such as volatility in fossil fuel prices, a continuing drop price of renewable energy technologies, large divestments from fossil fuel industries leading to stranded assets and reduction in interest from financial institutions to finance large fossil fuel based energy generation, rapid advancements in energy storage technologies, the effects of climate change and a paradigm shift in the views on optimal energy mix are affecting Cambodia’s electricity expansion.Given this context, UNDP is supporting the government to come up with evidence based policy and programme formulation to expand electricity access through solar energy.",科学研究,"Home-based with three in-country missions to Cambodia,  CAMBODIA                      ",30 woking days from the 4th week of September to the 4th week of December 2017,30 woking days from the 4th week of September to the 4th week of December 2017,Sep-19-17,"Education:Bachelor of Science, Engineering or related fieldExperience:At least 15 year experience in providing policy support on energy (particular in energy access and renewable energy) and climate change.Familiar with energy issue in Cambodia or within the region.Experience working in policy and programme/project formulation for UNDP.Strong writing and drafting skills.Language Requirement:Excellent spoken and written English language skills requiredInterested offeror must read the Individual Consultant (IC) Procurement Notice, which can be viewed at http://procurement-notices.undp.org/view_notice.cfm?notice_id=40554 for more detail information about term of references, instructions to offeror, and to download the documents to be submitted in the offer through online.UNDP reserves right to reject any applications that is incomplete.Please be informed that we don’t accept application submitted via email.Interested Offerors are required to submit application via UNDP jobsite system as the application screening and evaluation will be done through UNDP jobsite system.
